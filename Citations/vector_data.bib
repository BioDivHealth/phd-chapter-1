	volume = {85},
	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the major vector of the Dengue, Yellow Fever, and Chikungunya viruses. The subspecies Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa) has a global distribution while Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) is limited to Sub-Saharan Africa. We used McClelland's scoring of the frst abdominal tergite to subdivide Aaf collected in Senegal into form {\textless}{\textgreater} (no white scales) and form {\textless}{\textgreater} (white scales present). Average fecundity was observed within F or G+ forms but few eggs and very few larvae were produced in F x G+ crosses. Analysis of the Argo2 gene identifed distinct SNPS associated with F or G+ forms. {\textless}{\textgreater} markers predominated in the southeastern, forested regions of Senegal and the {\textless}{\textgreater}.markers predominated in western and northern Senegal. Analysis of genotype frequencies demonstrated that 29.2\% (31/106) of tests departed signifcantly from HWE and 25 of the 31 signifcant tests had an excess of homozygotes. Wahlund's effect is one explanation for this and occurs when a collection is sampled as a single reproductive pool, when there are actually two or more reproductively isolated populations. When the Aaf {\textless}{\textgreater} were analyzed separately, genotypes ft HWE. However, when Aaf {\textless}{\textgreater} was analyzed, an excess of homozygotes continued to be observed; suggesting that the {\textless}{\textgreater} form may consist of more than one reproductively isolated subspecies. Linkage disequilibrium analysis of SNPs in cDNAs was performed on 10 different populations from Senegal, and 10 populations from throughout the world. There was a large amount of disequilibrium among alleles on all three chromosomes. We tested for suppression of recombination associated with inversions that had been previously detected in Aaf. We crossed {\textless}{\textgreater} males with Higgs White Eye (HWE) Aaa females and then backcrossed male F1 to HWE females. We anticipated fnding suppressed recombination or that the we locus would be 14cM from the Sex locus as previously reported. Instead the loci were 14cM apart in some families but unlinked in others suggesting a translocation. All of these results suggest that Aaf is comprised of multiple subspecies in West Africa that can be distinguished based upon chromosomal polymorphisms and molecular genetic markers.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue viruses. The epidemiology of dengue fever remains poorly understood in Senegal. A sylvatic transmission seems to predominate. However, despite the sylvatic circulation of the dengue virus and the presence of vectors in urban areas, only sporadic cases have been reported. Ae. aegypti is a polytypic species. In Senegal, a purely sylvatic form is found in the forest gallery areas and a domestic form is found in the villages in savannah and sahelian areas and in urban areas. Using allozymes, we analyzed the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations differing in their ecological characteristics. Populations from Senegal were significantly structured but with a low level of genetic differentiation. Ae. aegypti from the "domestic" populations show a decreased genetic diversity and a lower genetic differentiation compared with "sylvatic" populations. These findings suggest that environmental conditions, ecological factors, and human activities may impact the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations in Senegal.},

Isolates were obtained from previously described vectors, Aedes furcifer, Ae. taylori, Ae. luteocephalus, and--for the first time in Senegal--from Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus. A retrospective analysis of sylvatic DENV-2 outbreaks in Senegal during the last 28 years of entomologic investigations shows that amplifications are periodic, with intervening, silent intervals of 5-8 years. No correlation was found between sylvatic DENV-2 emergence and rainfall amount. For sylvatic DENV-2 vectors, rainfall seems to particularly affect virus amplification that occurs at the end of the rainy season, from October to November. Data obtained from investigation of preimaginal (i.e., nonadult) mosquitoes suggest a secondary transmission cycle involving mosquitoes other than those identified previously as vectors.},

	abstract = {The recent development of analytical models of trypanosomiasis has increased the general applicability of models to the strategic control of the disease. An analysis of detailed data on tsetse abundance and infection rates and trypanosome prevalence in village-based trypanotolerant cattle over 4 years in The Gambia showed that seasonal patterns of abundance in Glossina morsitans-infested areas were consistent, and that the rates of trypanosome infection remained relatively unchanging. However, there were two distinct seasonal trypanosome prevalence patterns in cattle, with peaks occurring either in May/June/July or November/December. The peaks of trypanosome prevalence therefore occurred either 4 months before or after the times of peak challenge from G. morsitans, not 1 or 2 months after as predicted by analytical models. In G. palpalis-infested areas there was little seasonal variation in abundance or trypanosome infections, but peak trypanosome prevalence still occurred mostly in June/July. Despite the incongruity between the months of peak prevalence and challenge, the overall annual prevalence rates and tsetse challenge indices showed a significant linear relationship. It is concluded that existing analytical models need to be refined to take into account trypanotolerance and the various influences on the expression of this trait.},

	abstract = {BackgroundA mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance system was set up at Barkedji, Senegal after the first outbreak of Rift valley fever in West Africa in 1988. This system was recently updated using more sampling methods and collecting in greater number of ponds and villages sites.MethodsFor the current study, mosquitoes were sampled biweekly between July and December 2012 and 2013 using CDC+CO2 light traps set at ground and canopy level, mosquito nets baited with goat, sheep, human or chicken, light traps baited with goat, sheep and chicken; bird-baited traps using pigeons or chickens placed either at the ground or canopy level. Collected mosquitoes were identified, pooled and screened for arboviruses.ResultsA total of 42,969 mosquitoes in 4,429 pools were processed for virus isolation. Ten virus species were identified among 103 virus isolates. West Nile virus (WNV; 31 isolates), Barkedji virus (BARV; 18), Sindbis virus (SINV; 13), Usutu virus (USUV; 12), Acado virus (ACAV; 8), Ndumu virus (NDUV; 9), Sanar virus (SANV; 7), Bagaza virus (BAGV; 3), Rift valley fever virus (RVFV; 1), and Yaounde virus (YAOV; 1) were isolated from 9 ponds (91 strains) and 7 villages (12 strains). Only 3 virus species (WNV, NDU and SINV) were isolated from villages. The largest numbers of isolates were collected in October (29.1\% of total isolates) and November (50.5\%). Viruses were isolated from 14 mosquito species including Cx. neavei (69.9\% of the strains), Cx. antennatus (9.7\%), and Ma. uniformis (4.8\%). NDUV, ACAV, and SINV are herein reported for the first time in the Barkedji area. Isolation of ACAV and SANV from a pool of male Ma. uniformis and USUV and BARV from a pool of male Cx. neavei, are reported for the first time to our knowledge.ConclusionOur data indicate that the Barkedji area is characterized by a high diversity of viruses of medical, veterinary and unknown importance. Arboviruses were first detected in July at the beginning of the rainy season and peaked in abundance in October and November. The Barkedji area, an enzootic focus of several potentially emerging arboviruses, should be surveilled annually to be prepared to deal with future disease emergence events.},

	abstract = {The dispersal, population dynamics, and age structure of two Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus: Bunyaviridae) (RVFV) vectors, Aedes vexans Meigen and Culex poicilipes Theobald, were investigated in northern Senegal. The main objective was to investigate possible factors that mediate RVFV emergence and propagation at a site where humans and livestock live in proximity to temporary surface pools. In mark-release-recapture studies, recapture rates of 0.18\% (156/85,500) and 3.46\% (201/5,800) were obtained for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The number of mosquitoes recaptured decreased with increasing distance from the release point and over time. The estimated daily survival rate for released females ranged from 91 to 96\% for Ae. vexans and 70-79\% for Cx. poicilipes. The maximum time after release when marked mosquitoes were collected was 23 and 12 d for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The maximum distances from the release point that marked females were recaptured was 620 and 550 m for Ae vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. Rainfall periodicity was a key factor controlling Ae. vexans population abundance. In contrast, rainfall had no discernible effect on the fluctuation of Cx. poicilipes numbers. The involvement of these two species in the transmission of RVFV is discussed with respect to their longevity and daily survival rate. © 2005 Entomological Society of America.},

A field study was carried out in The Gambia to investigate the effects of human odor or synthetic odor blends on the attraction of mosquitoes. MM-X traps baited with 16 odor blends to which carbon dioxide (CO2) was added were tested in four sets of experiments. In a second series of experiments, MM-X traps with 14 odor blends without CO2 were tested. A blend of ammonia and L-lactic acid with or without CO2 was used as control odor in series 1 and 2, respectively. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traps were placed in a traditional house and an experimental house to monitor mosquito densities during the experiments. The MM-X traps caught a total number of 196,756 mosquitoes, with the most abundant species belonging to the genera Mansonia (70.6\%), Anopheles (17.5\%), and Culex (11.5\%). The most abundant mosquito species caught by the CDC traps (56,290 in total) belonged to the genera Mansonia (59.4\%), Anopheles (16.0\% An. gambiae s.l. Giles, and 11.3\% An. ziemanni Grunberg), and Culex (11.6\%). MM-X traps baited with synthetic blends were in many cases more attractive than MM-X traps baited with human odors. Addition of CO2 to synthetic odors substantially increased the catch of all mosquito species in the MM-X traps. A blend of ammonia + L-lactic acid + CO, + 3-methylbutanoic acid was the most attractive odor for most mosquito species. The candidate odor blend shows the potential to enhance trap collections so that traps will provide better surveillance and possible control.},

In total, 81,219 specimens, belonging to 60 species and 7 genera, were collected. The most abundant species were Aedes furcifer (Edwards) (Diptera: Culicidae) (20.7\%), Ae. vittatus (Bigot) (19.5\%), Ae. dalzieli (Theobald) (14.7\%), and Ae. luteocephalus (Newstead) (13.7\%). Ae. dalzieli, Ae. furcifer, Ae. vittatus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. taylori Edwards, Ae. africanus (Theobald), Ae. minutus (Theobald), Anopheles coustani Laveran, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Mansonia uniformis (Theobald) comprised {\textgreater}=10\% of the total collection, in at least one land cover. The lowest species richness and Brillouin diversity index (HB = 1.55) were observed in the forest-canopy. The urban-indoor fauna showed the highest dissimilarity with other land covers and was most similar to the urban-outdoor fauna following Jaccard and Morisita index. Mosquito abundance peaked in June and October 2009 and July and October 2010. The highest species density was recorded in October. The maximum temperature was correlated positively with mean temperature and negatively with rainfall and relative humidity. Rainfall showed a positive correlation with mosquito abundance and species density. These data will be useful for understanding the transmission of arboviruses and human malaria in the region.

	abstract = {Malaria transmission by Anopheles funestus was investigated from May 1994 to September 1997 in different locations from western to eastern Senegal along the northern border of The Gambia. 10515 A. funestus were captured on human volunteers or by indoor pyrethrum spraying. Circumsporozoite protein rates showed that A. funestus had a high infection rate, 2-7\%, in the whole of the study area. Analysis of feeding behaviour showed great variation of anthropophilic rates from western Senegal, where populations were highly anthropophilic, to eastern Senegal, where they were much more zoophilic. In eastern Senegal many females captured in bedrooms had fed outside on horses. Polytene chromosome analysis showed that the general pattern of karyotype distribution is consistent with the hypothesis of 3 chromosomally differentiated populations of A. funestus. In samples from a central part of the study area, analysis showed lack of karyotype intergradation with a deficit of heterokaryotypes, suggesting the presence of 2 genetically differentiated populations in an area of sympatry.},

Four species amounted to 97\% of human-bait sampling: Anopheles gambiae molecular form S. An. arabiensis, An. funestus, and An. nili s.s. All An gambiae and An. nili females were fed on human, whereas the anthropophilic rate was 94.5\% for An. funestus and 88.9\% for An. arabiensis. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite found, and infecting only An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. funestus, and An. nili. The circumsporozoite rate was 4.5\% for An gambiae, 1.6\% for An arabien, is, 3.9\% for An. funestus, and 2.1\% for An. niti. During the period of study, the entomological inoculation rate was estimated to 264 infected bites. An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. funestus, and An. niti were responsible respectively of 56, 3 20, and 21\% of malaria transmission. This study shows for the first time the implication of An, nili in malaria transmission in this area and the complexity of the malaria vectorial system that should be taken into account for any malaria control strategy.},

	abstract = {Anopheles funestus is one of the major vectors of malaria in Africa. Cytogenetic studies conducted on populations from West Africa have shown variable degrees of polymorphism with a genetic structure leading to the description of two chromosomal forms called Folonzo and Kiribina that exhibit limited gene flow. Because studies on allopatric populations showed bionomical heterogeneities, the present study was undertaken during three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) in an area of sympatry in Senegal, in order to assess their bionomical characteristics and compare their epidemiologic role in malaria transmission. Overall, the two forms coexisted in the study area; the Kiribina form being more abundant and exhibiting higher biting rates. Based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the anthropophilic rates were statistically comparable and were, respectively, 30.7\% and 28.6\% for Kiribina and Folonzo. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite rates were also comparable and were 2.7\% for Kiribina and 3.1\% for Folonzo. Both forms were involved in malaria transmission; Kiribina being responsible for 68\% of transmission. Thus, due to the limited gene flow between the two forms, the introduction of transgene for Plasmodium resistance in one of the two forms could be a disadvantage for the implementation of control strategies based on the use of Plasmodium-refractory genetically modified individuals. Nevertheless, it could represent an advantage limiting the insurgence of insecticide resistance gene spread between forms and should be taken into account for the implementation of control strategies.},

To fill this gap, Ae. aegypti blood-fed females were collected in five localities by aspiration and using BG Sentinel 2 traps. Collections were carried out monthly between July and November 2019 inside and outside human dwellings. The origin of the blood meal of Ae. aegypti females were identified by an ELISA technique. A total of 1,710 blood-engorged females were examined and showed that Ae. aegypti preferentially fed on human with 78.6\% of the identified blood meals. The other blood meals were from animals including dog, cat, horse, cattle, sheep, and rat. This is the first report on the feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti in urban settings in West Africa.

	abstract = {Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the main vectors of animal and human trypanosomoses in Africa. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has proven effective in controlling tsetse flies when applied to isolated populations but necessitates the production of large numbers of sterile males. A new approach, called boosted SIT, combining SIT with the contamination of wild females by sterile males coated with biocides has been proposed for large-scale control of vector populations. The aim of the study was to evaluate this new approach using pyriproxyfen on the riverine species Glossina palpalis gambiensis (Vanderplank, 1949) in the laboratory. The contamination dose and persistence of pyriproxyfen on sterile males, the impact of pyriproxyfen on male survival, and the dynamics of pyriproxyfen transfer from a sterile male to a female during mating, as well as the impact of pyriproxyfen on pupal production and adult emergence, were evaluated in the laboratory. For this purpose, a method of treatment by impregnating sterile males with a powder containing 40\% pyriproxyfen has been developed. The results showed that the pyriproxyfen has no impact on the survival of sterile males. Pyriproxyfen persisted on sterile males for up to 10 days at a dose of 100ng per fly. In addition, the horizontal transfer of pyriproxyfen from a treated sterile male to a female during mating could be measured with an average of 50ng of pyriproxyfen transferred. After contacts without mating, the average quantity transferred was more than 10ng. Finally, the pyriproxyfen powder was very effective on G. p. gambiensis leading to 0\% emergence of the pupae produced by contaminated females. These promising results must be confirmed in the field. A large-scale assessment of this boosted pyriproxyfen-based SIT approach will be carried out against tsetse flies in Senegal (West Africa).},

These viral diseases are causing an increased public health burden, which impedes poverty reduction and sustainable development. Aedes surveillance and control capacity, which are key to reducing the prevalence of arboviral infections, need to be strengthened in West Africa, to provide information essential for the formulation of effective vector control strategies and the prediction of arboviral disease outbreaks.

	abstract = {The daily flight activity patterns of one of the main vectors of animal trypanosomiasis in West Africa, Glossina morsitans submorsitans, were assessed using four different methods. Results from all the methods showed that there was some flight activity nearly every hour in all seasons but they differed in the level of contact between grazing cattle herds and G.m.submorsitans. In the late dry season, trap data indicated that there was negligible activity from midday to late afternoon, whereas observations of tsetse contact with cattle herds or hand-net collections on herd followings showed no fall in attack rates, on the cattle by G.m.submorsitans. Differences between trap and animal-baited collection data may be attributable to the type of G.m.submorsitans sampled by each method. Male G.m.submorsitans captured by traps were more fat depleted than those caught on ox-baited flyrounds or by hand-net collections on herd followings. All methods showed that male G.m.submorsitans were most fat depleted in the late dry season and least in the early dry season. It was concluded that the traps were mainly sampling the spontaneous flights of G.m.submorsitans. Hunger and endogenous rhythms increase the likelihood of spontaneous flights towards dusk, particularly in conditions such as those at midday in the very hot, late dry season. However, the presence of cattle herds in infested habitats probably activated nearby G.m.submorsitans and the continual movement through the grazing areas ensured contact with tsetse throughout grazing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, often found in sympatry and synchronous, have undergone a premating reproductive isolation across their distribution range. However, in the Western coast of Africa, unexpected hybridization zones have been observed, and little is known about swarming behavior of these cryptic taxa. Here, we characterized the swarming behavior of An. coluzzii and An. gambiae to investigate its role in the high hybridization level in Senegal. The study was conducted in the south and central Senegal during the 2018 rainy season. Mating swarms of malaria vectors were surveyed at sunset and collected using an insect net. Meanwhile, indoor resting populations of malaria vectors were collected by pyrethrum spray catches. Upon collection, specimens were identified morphologically, and then members of the An. gambiae complex were identified at the species level by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An. gambiae swarmed mainly over bare ground, whereas An. coluzzii were found swarming above various objects creating a dark-light contrast with the bare ground. The swarms height varied from 0.5 to 2.5 m. Swarming starting time was correlated with sunset whatever the months for both species, and generally lasted about 10 min. No mixed swarm of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii was found even in the high hybridization area. These results indicated a premating isolation between An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. However, the high hybridization rate in the sympatric area suggests that heterogamous mating is occurring, thus stressing the need for further extensive studies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sterile insect technique (SIT) requires mass-rearing of the target species, irradiation to induce sexual sterility and transportation from the mass-rearing facility to the target site. Those treatments require several steps that may affect the biological quality of sterile males. This study has been carried out to evaluate the relative impact of chilling, irradiation and transport on emergence rate, flight ability and survival of sterile male Glossina palpalis gambiensis., RESULTS: Chilling, irradiation and transport all affected the quality control parameters studied. The emergence rate was significantly reduced by long chilling periods and transport, i.e. from 92\% at the source insectary in Burkina Faso to 78\% upon arrival in Senegal. Flight ability was affected by all three parameters with 31\% operational flies lost between the production facility and the destination site. Only survival under stress was not affected by any of the treatments., CONCLUSION: The chilling period and transport were the main factors that impacted significantly the quality of sterile male pupae. Therefore, in the operational programme, the delivery of sterile male pupae was divided over two shipments per week to reduce the chilling time and improve the quality of the sterile males. Quality of the male pupae may further be improved by reducing the transport time and vibrations during transport.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2006.07.012},
	abstract = {During the rainy season the abundance of mosquitoes over the Ferlo region (Senegal) is linked to dynamic, vegetation cover and turbidity of temporary and relatively small ponds. The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10 m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatio-temporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: i.e., the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5 ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65\% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90\% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25\% of the Ferlo region, while only 0.9\% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. The remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment.

	abstract = {Background: Climate and environment vary across many spatio-temporal scales, including the concept of climate change, which impact on ecosystems, vector-borne diseases and public health worldwide. Objectives: To develop a conceptual approach by mapping climatic and environmental conditions from space and studying their linkages with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemics in Senegal. Design: Ponds in which mosquitoes could thrive were identified from remote sensing using high-resolution SPOT-5 satellite images. Additional data on pond dynamics and rainfall events (obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) were combined with hydrological in-situ data. Localisation of vulnerable hosts such as penned cattle (from QuickBird satellite) were also used. Results: Dynamic spatio-temporal distribution of Aedes vexans density (one of the main RVF vectors) is based on the total rainfall amount and ponds' dynamics. While Zones Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes are mapped, detailed risk areas, i.e. zones where hazards and vulnerability occur, are expressed in percentages of areas where cattle are potentially exposed to mosquitoes' bites. Conclusions: This new conceptual approach, using precise remote-sensing techniques, simply relies upon rainfall distribution also evaluated from space. It is meant to contribute to the implementation of operational early warning systems for RVF based on both natural and anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes. In a climate change context, this approach could also be applied to other vector-borne diseases and places worldwide.},

	abstract = {Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne viral zoonosis of increasing global importance. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted either through exposure to infected animals or through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. These mosquitoes are very sensitive to environmental conditions, which may determine their presence, biology, and abundance. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. The assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution therefore needs to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A hydrological model is combined with a mosquito population model to predict the abundance of the two main mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) involved in RVFV transmission in Senegal. The study area is an agropastoral zone located in the Ferlo Valley, characterized by a dense network of temporary water ponds which constitute mosquito breeding sites. The hydrological model uses daily rainfall as input to simulate variations of pond surface areas. The mosquito population model is mechanistic, considers both aquatic and adult stages and is driven by pond dynamics. Once validated using hydrological and entomological field data, the model was used to simulate the abundance dynamics of the two mosquito species over a 43-year period (1961-2003). We analysed the predicted dynamics of mosquito populations with regards to the years of main outbreaks. The results showed that the main RVF outbreaks occurred during years with simultaneous high abundances of both species. Conclusion/Significance: Our study provides for the first time a mechanistic insight on RVFV transmission in West Africa. It highlights the complementary roles of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes in virus transmission, and recommends the identification of rainfall patterns favourable for RVFV amplification.},

The possible confounding effect of infection with Plasmodium parasites was removed by eliminating infected mosquitoes from the study samples. An.arabiensis females comprised 75\% of the An.gambiae sensu late population and were significantly larger (greater mean wing length) than those of An.gambiae s.s. mosquitoes. Mean egg production per female (for the subsequent gonotrophic cycle, excluding pre-gravids) for the two species was not significantly different, though the relationship between wing length and egg production showed An.gambiae s.s. to be more fecund than the An.arabiensis of the same size. Pregravid An.gambiae s.s. had consumed significantly smaller bloodmeals than gravid females but the mean wing length of these two gonotrophic categories was not significantly different. In contrast, An.arabiensis pre-gravids were smaller and had consumed smaller bloodmeals than the gravids.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the Niayes area, located in the west of Senegal, only one tsetse species, Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae) was present. The Government of Senegal initiated and implemented an elimination programme in this area that included a sterile insect technique (SIT) component. The G. p. gambiensis strain (BKF) mass-reared at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES) in Burkina Faso was used for the SIT component., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Studies conducted in 2011 in four localities in the Niayes area (Pout, Sebikotane, Diacksao Peul and the Parc de Hann) showed that the BKF strain demonstrated inferior survival in the ecosystem of the Parc de Hann, a forested area in the city centre of the capital Dakar. Therefore, G. p. gambiensis flies from the Niayes area (SEN strain) were colonized. Here we compared the competitiveness and survival of the two strains (BKF and SEN) in the Parc de Hann. Released sterile males of the SEN colony showed a daily mortality rate of 0.08 (SD 0.08) as compared with 0.14 (SD 0.08) for the BKF flies but the difference was not significant (p-value = 0.14). However, the competitiveness of the SEN males was lower (0.14 (SD 0.10)) as compared with that of the BKF males (0.76 (SD 0.11)) (p-value {\textless} 10-3)., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the BKF strain will remain the main strain to be used in the elimination programme. Despite the slightly longer survival of the SEN males in the Parc de Hann, the superior competitiveness of the BKF males is deemed more important for the SIT component, as their shorter survival rates can be easily compensated for by more frequent fly releases.},

	abstract = {The authors finalize the knowledge on the ecology of the CCHF virus in Senegal, West Africa. They specify two new major data for the understanding of the viral ecology in West Africa. The recognition of a bird species, common and widely distributed in Senegal (Tockus erythrorhynchus, Coraciiformes, Bucerotidae), that replicates the virus and infects the immature stages of its current parasite Hyalomma marginatum rufipes in more than 90\% of the cases, explains why the minimum infection rate of the adults of this species of tick is always very high. The implication of Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi in the viral ecology and/or a high efficiency of the transovarial transmission of the virus in Hy. m. rufipes would help to explain the maintenance of the endemy in the sahelian area. In the sahelian zone, Hy. marginatum rufipes must play the leading part, together with Rh. e. evertsi if vector, for the maintenance of the endemy. Hy. truncatum, the adults of which can readily bite man, ensures the vectorial transmission to him. In the sudanian zone, Amblyomma variegatum must play the same part as the Hyalomma and Rh. e. evertsi (if vector), and is surely the main vector to man, giving perhaps rise to less virulent strains (non hemorrhagic ones).},

	abstract = {Background Mosquitoes are colonized by a large but mostly uncharacterized natural virome of RNA viruses, and the composition and distribution of the natural RNA virome may influence the biology and immunity of Anopheles malaria vector populations. Results Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled in malaria endemic forest village sites in Senegal and Cambodia, including Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae group sp., and Anopheles coustani in Senegal, and Anopheles hyrcanus group sp., Anopheles maculatus group sp., and Anopheles dirus in Cambodia. The most frequent mosquito species sampled at both study sites are human malaria vectors. Small and long RNA sequences were depleted of mosquito host sequences, de novo assembled and clustered to yield non-redundant contigs longer than 500 nucleotides. Analysis of the assemblies by sequence similarity to known virus families yielded 115 novel virus sequences, and evidence supports a functional status for at least 86 of the novel viral contigs. Important monophyletic virus clades in the Bunyavirales and Mononegavirales orders were found in these Anopheles from Africa and Asia. The remaining non-host RNA assemblies that were unclassified by sequence similarity to known viruses were clustered by small RNA profiles, and 39 high-quality independent contigs strongly matched a pattern of classic RNAi processing of viral replication intermediates, suggesting they are entirely undescribed viruses. One thousand five hundred sixty-six additional high-quality unclassified contigs matched a pattern consistent with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), suggesting that strand-biased piRNAs are generated from the natural virome in Anopheles. To functionally query piRNA effect, we analyzed piRNA expression in Anopheles coluzzii after infection with O'nyong nyong virus (family Togaviridae), and identified two piRNAs that appear to display specifically altered abundance upon arbovirus infection. Conclusions Anopheles vectors of human malaria in Africa and Asia are ubiquitously colonized by RNA viruses, some of which are monophyletic but clearly diverged from other arthropod viruses. The interplay between small RNA pathways, immunity, and the virome may represent part of the homeostatic mechanism maintaining virome members in a commensal or nonpathogenic state, and could potentially influence vector competence.},

The gold standard approach for mosquito collection is that of Human Landing Catch (HLC) in which an individual exposes bare skin to possibly infected vectors. Here, we present the development of a new method for mosquito collection, the InfoScitex Tent (IST), which utilizes modern tent materials coupled with a novel trap design. This provides an efficacious, non-labor intensive, and safe method for vector collection. In these initial studies, we found it collected an average of 31.5 Anopheles gambiae s.l. per trap per night in rural villages in Southeastern Senegal, and 42.5 Culex group V per trap per night in the semi-urban town of Kedougou, Senegal. In direct comparisons to HLC, the tent was not statistically different for collection of Cx. quinquefasciatus in crepuscular sampling, but was significantly less efficacious at trapping the highly motile dusk biter Aedes aegypti. These studies suggest that the IST tent is a viable and safe alternative to HLC for Anopheles and Culex sampling in areas of high vector-borne disease infection risk.},

G. p. gambiensis occurred in evergreen forest and woodland near the coast, and in riparian habitats along the length of the River Gambia and its major tributaries. Nowhere in the country was more than 20 km from tsetse-infested areas. Five major foci of G. m. submorsitans infestation were identified. Demographic, climatic and environmental factors affect tsetse populations in The Gambia, but it is expected that these foci of infestation will persist for at least the next 5-10 years. The numbers of tsetse trapped, expressed as relative densities, were used to assess the extent and severity of losses from trypanosomiasis to different categories of livestock. Survey results such as these could be used to assess whether control measures to reduce tsetse challenge are likely to be economically viable by using techniques such as insecticide-impregnated targets, pour-ons or chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {Background: Malaria in The Gambia is highly seasonal, with transmission occurring as Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations expand during and immediately after a single annual rainy season that lasts from June to October. There has been very limited investigation of the ecology of vectors during the dry season, when numbers are very limited and distributions may be restricted. Methods: Weekly adult mosquito collections (pyrethrum spray, light trap, and search collections from rooms, as well as light trap collections from animal shelters, abandoned wells and grain stores), and artificial sentinel breeding site surveys were performed in four villages near the upper tidal and partially saline part of the Gambia River in the last four months of an annual dry season (March to June). Mosquito species were identified by morphological and DNA analysis, and ELISA assays were performed to test for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites and human blood meal components. Results: Adults of An. gambiae s.l. were collected throughout the period, numbers increasing towards the end of the dry season when humidity was increasing. Adult collections were dominated by An. melas (86\%), with An. gambiae s.s. (10\%) and An. arabiensis (3\%) also present throughout. Most females collected in room search and spray collections contained blood meals, but most from light traps were unfed. None of the females tested (n = 1709) contained sporozoites. Larvae (mostly An. gambiae s. s.) were recovered from artificial sentinel breeding sites in the two villages that had freshwater pools. These two villages had the highest proportions of An. gambiae s. s. adults, and experienced the most substantial increase in proportions of An. gambiae s. s. after the onset of rains. Conclusion: During the dry season population minimum, An. melas was the predominant vector species, but differences among villages in availability of fresh-water breeding sites correlate with egg laying activity and relative numbers of An. gambiae s. s. adults, and with the increase in this species immediately after the beginning of the rains. Local variation in dry season vector persistence is thus likely to influence spatial heterogeneity of transmission intensity in the early part of the rainy season.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many zoonotic infectious diseases have emerged and re-emerged over the last two decades. There has been a significant increase in vector-borne diseases due to climate variations that lead to environmental changes favoring the development and adaptation of vectors. This study was carried out to improve knowledge of the ecology of mosquito vectors involved in the transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Senegal., METHODS: An entomological survey was conducted in three Senegalese agro-systems, Senegal River Delta (SRD), Senegal River Valley (SRV) and Ferlo, during the rainy season (July to November) of 2014 and 2015. Mosquitoes were trapped using CDC light traps set at ten sites for two consecutive nights during each month of the rainy season, for a total of 200 night-traps. Ecological indices were calculated to characterize the different populations of RVFV mosquito vectors. Generalized linear models with mixed effects were used to assess the influence of climatic conditions on the abundance of RVFV mosquito vectors., RESULTS: A total of 355,408 mosquitoes belonging to 7 genera and 35 species were captured in 200 night-traps. RVFV vectors represented 89.02\% of the total, broken down as follows: Ae. vexans arabiensis (31.29\%), Cx. poicilipes (0.6\%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (33.09\%) and Ma. uniformis (24.04\%). Comparison of meteorological indices (rainfall, temperature, relative humidity), abundances and species diversity indicated that there were no significant differences between SRD and SRV (P = 0.36) while Ferlo showed significant differences with both (P {\textless} 0.001). Mosquito collection increased significantly with temperature for Ae. vexans arabiensis (P {\textless} 0.001), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (P = 0.04) and Ma. uniformis (P = 0.01), while Cx. poicilipes decreased (P = 0.003). Relative humidity was positively and significantly associated with the abundances of Ae. vexans arabiensis (P {\textless} 0.001), Cx. poicilipes (P = 0.01) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (P = 0.007). Rainfall had a positive and significant effect on the abundances of Ae. vexans arabiensis (P = 0.005). The type of biotope (temporary ponds, river or lake) around the trap points had a significant effect on the mosquito abundances (P {\textless} 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In terms of species diversity, the SRD and SRV ecosystems are similar to each other and different from that of Ferlo. Meteorological indices and the type of biotope (river, lake or temporary pond) have significant effects on the abundance of RVFV mosquito vectors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) originated in a sylvatic cycle of transmission between non-human animal hosts and vector mosquitoes in the forests of Africa. Subsequently the virus jumped out of this ancestral cycle into a human-endemic transmission cycle vectored by anthropophilic mosquitoes. Sylvatic CHIKV cycles persist in Africa and continue to spill over into humans, creating the potential for new CHIKV strains to enter human-endemic transmission. To mitigate such spillover, it is first necessary to delineate the distributions of the sylvatic mosquito vectors of CHIKV, to identify the environmental factors that shape these distributions, and to determine the association of mosquito presence with key drivers of virus spillover, including mosquito and CHIKV abundance. We therefore modeled the distribution of seven CHIKV mosquito vectors over two sequential rainy seasons in Kedougou, Senegal using Maxent., METHODS: Mosquito data were collected in fifty sites distributed in five land cover classes across the study area. Environmental data representing land cover, topographic, and climatic factors were included in the models. Models were compared and evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) statistics. The correlation of model outputs with abundance of individual mosquito species as well as CHIKV-positive mosquito pools was tested., RESULTS: Fourteen models were produced and evaluated; the environmental variables most strongly associated with mosquito distributions were distance to large patches of forest, landscape patch size, rainfall, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Seven models were positively correlated with mosquito abundance and one (Aedes taylori) was consistently, positively correlated with CHIKV-positive mosquito pools. Eight models predicted high relative occurrence rates of mosquitoes near the villages of Tenkoto and Ngary, the areas with the highest frequency of CHIKV-positive mosquito pools., CONCLUSIONS: Of the environmental factors considered here, landscape fragmentation and configuration had the strongest influence on mosquito distributions. Of the mosquito species modeled, the distribution of Ae. taylori correlated most strongly with abundance of CHIKV, suggesting that presence of this species will be a useful predictor of sylvatic CHIKV presence.},

	abstract = {The urban area of Dakar, Senegal, contains {\textgreater} 5,000 market-garden wells that provide permanent sites for mosquito larvae, in particular Anopheles arabiensis Patton, the major vector of malaria. A study of the bioecology of mosquito larvae was conducted over 1 yr with a monthly visit to 48 of these wells. Overall, 9,589 larvae were collected of which 80.1\% were Culicinae and 11.9\% Anophelinae. Larvae from stages III and IV (n = 853) were identified to 10 species. An. arabiensis represented 86\% of the anophelines collected and An. ziemanni Grunberg 14\%. The most common Culicinae species included Aedeomyia africana Neveu-Lemaire, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Mimomyia splendens Theobald. Maximum anopheline abundance was observed at the end of the dry season in June, whereas maximum Culicinae abundance was observed at the end of the rainy season in September. Most wells (67\%) did not harbor any An. arabiensis larvae and in the remaining 33\% the larval abundance was low, averaging 0.54 larvae in stages III-IV per tray sample. To identify factors that determine the abundance of larvae in these wells, a co-inertia (multivariate) analysis was carried out to account for physicochemical variables (depth, turbidity, temperature, pH, conductivity, Na+, Cl-, HCO3-, CO3--, and NO3- concentrations) and biological variables (abundance of mosquito species, predators [e.g., fish, Dytiscidae, Notonectidae, odonates], molluscs [Bulinus and Biomphalaria], and surface plants [water lettuce, Lemna, and filamentous algae]). The co-inertia analysis indicated that the abundance of An. arabiensis was associated with Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. decens for the physiochemical data but was not associated with other mosquito species for floro-faunistic data. The conditions associated with abundant An. arabiensis were warm temperature (28-30 degrees C), clear and not too deep water ({\textless} 0.5 m), elevated concentrations of HCO3- and CO3--, low concentrations of NO3- and NaCl, low populations of larvivorous fish and invertebrate predators (notably odonates), the presence of water lettuce, and an absence of Lemna. These results indicate that many contributing factors influence the ecology of the immature stages of An. arabiensis.},

This is even more important to understand when dealing with important neglected diseases and their vectors. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we analysed genetic divergence, computed from seven microsatellite loci, of 614 tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina palpalis palpalis, major vectors of animal and human trypanosomes) from 28 sites of West and Central Africa. We found that the two subspecies are so divergent that they deserve the species status. Controlling for geographic and time distances that separate these samples, which have a significant effect, we found that G. p. gambiensis from different landscapes (Niayes of Senegal, savannah and coastal environments) were significantly genetically different and thus represent different ecotypes or subspecies. We also confirm that G. p. palpalis from Ivory Coast, Cameroon and DRC are strongly divergent. Conclusions/Significance These results provide an opportunity to examine whether new tsetse fly ecotypes might display different behaviour, dispersal patterns, host preferences and vectorial capacities. This work also urges a revision of taxonomic status of Glossina palpalis subspecies and highlights again how fast ecological divergence can be, especially in host-parasite-vector systems.},

	abstract = {Studies were conducted to determine the effect of environmental temperature on the ability of Senegalese Aedes fowleri to transmit Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Temperatures tested included 17degreeC, 28degreeC and a cyclic (17-28degreeC) regimen designed to mimic temperatures to which a mosquito might be exposed in October in southeastern Senegal. After per oral exposure, infection rates were similar (ca. 93\%) for all three groups. However, RVF virus disseminated to the haemocoel more rapidly in mosquitoes held at higher temperatures, with peak dissemination rates (ca. 80\%) reached at 11, 18 and {\textgreater} 42 days after the infectious blood meal for mosquitoes held at 28degreeC, cyclic and 17degreeC, respectively. Likewise, the time interval between ingestion of the viremic blood meal and the first transmission by bite was inversely related to environmental temperature, with the first transmission occurring at 11, 18 and 35 days for mosquitoes held at 28degreeC, cyclic and 17degreeC, respectively. After being transferred from 17 to 28degreeC on days 7 or 14 after the infectious blood meal, mosquitoes rapidly developed a disseminated infection and transmitted virus by bite within 7 days. Environmental temperature significantly affected the vectorial capacity of A. fowleri for RVF virus, with transmission occurring earlier and at a higher rate in mosquitoes held at higher temperatures.},

Duration of control was dependent on formulation, dosage, exposure to sun, site, recycling, and target mosquito larvae. In a series of container tests with repeated additions of fourth-instar Culex quinquefasciatus larvae exposed to 0.3 or 3.0 g/m(2) when cadavers were not removed, more than 95 percent control was obtained for two and four days in containers that were exposed to the sun with sewage water treated with the flowable concentrate compared to four and seven days for those treated with the granule. In sun-exposed containers with sewage water, control persisted for two days for the flowable concentrate at both dosages and one and six days for the granule at 0.3 g/m(2) and 3.0 g/m(2), respectively. Compared to the above tests, more than seven weeks control was obtained with 0.3 g/m(2) of the flowable concentrate in closed containers where larvae were added weekly. In closed containers without weekly addition of larvae, the control was 15 percent when larvae were added five weeks after the treatment. Spore counts at the surface and bottom of the containers with lids showed an increase in number of spores at the surface where larvae were added weekly and a rapid decline where they were not. Spore counts at the bottom showed settling in both cases, but to a much higher level where larvae were added weekly. Nearly 100 percent control of Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae was obtained for at least 16 days in cesspools in Yaounde, Cameroon, treated with the granule at 3.0 g/m(2) compared to approximately nine days for the flowable concentrate. At 0.3 g/m(2), the duration of this reduction was five days for both products. Nearly 100 percent control of Anopheles gambiae was obtained in sun-exposed water ponds near the village Kotiokh, Senegal, for at least 15 days with the granule at 3.0 g/m(2) compared to just five days for the flowable concentrate at the same dosage.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, arbovirosis and lymphatic filariasis are major public health issues, particularly in Africa. In order to predict the risk of transmission of these diseases and plan optimal mosquito control interventions, it is vital to have updated information of the mosquito species present, as each of them has a different capacity to transmit different pathogens, and to monitor how these species vary over time, also in relation to environmental and climatic changes. This is achieved by entomological monitoring carried out by various types of traps, whose collection efficacy may vary depending on the mosquito species and the ecological and climatic situation. We carried out collections in two villages in Senegal and showed evidence of a decline of malaria vector species and an increase of lymphatic filarial vectors. Moreover, we showed that using different traps to collect female mosquitoes may provide different estimates of mosquito species composition over time, depending on geographical setting and season. This is very relevant for a correct planning of mosquito monitoring and for appropriate interpretation of the results. Mosquitoes-borne diseases are major public health issues particularly in Africa. Vector control interventions and human-made environmental/climatic changes significantly affect the distribution and abundance of vector species. We carried out an entomological survey targeting host-seeking mosquitos in two different ecological contexts-coastal and inland-in Senegal, by CDC-light and BG-sentinel traps. Results show high predominance of Culex quinquefasciatus (90\%) and of Anopheles arabiensis within malaria vectors (46\%), with mean numbers of females/trap/nights =8 and {\textless}1, respectively, reinforcing previous evidence of changes in species composition and abundance, highlighting thus increasing risk of transmission of filariasis and emerging arboviruses in the Senegambia region. From the methodological perspective, results show a higher specificity of BG traps for Cx. quinquefasciatus and of CDC traps for An. gambiae s.l. and highlight that, despite both traps target the host-seeking fraction of the population, they provide different patterns of species abundance, temporal dynamics and host-seeking activity, leading to possible misinterpretation of the species bionomics. This draws attention to the need of taking into account trapping performance, in order to provide realistic quantification of the number of mosquitoes per units of space and time, the crucial parameter for evaluating vector-human contact, and estimating risk of pathogen transmission.},

Here we show that the eradication campaign had very limited impacts on the apparent densities of the most frequent species as well as three diversity indexes during the reduction phase involving insecticides but reverted to pre-intervention levels as soon as the release of the sterile male insects started.

	abstract = {The buffy coat/dark ground phase contrast technique (BCT) and an indirect antibody enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) were employed to assess the trypanosomal status of 32 N'Dama cattle, aged 19-28 months, exposed to natural challenge of Glossina morsitans submorsitans and G. palpalis gambiensis. Prior to the start of the investigation animals experienced 9-16 months of tsetse challenge in the study area. Blood and corresponding serum samples were examined monthly for a period of 8 months for patent parasitaemia by BCT and presence of Trypanosoma vivax and T. congolense antibodies by ELISA. In the ELISA, the reactivity of sera to anti-trypanosomal antibodies was expressed in percent positivity (pp). Packed cell volumes (PCV) and body weights were also recorded monthly, and daily weight gain (DWG) computed to assess the impact of trypanosomal status on health and productivity. During the study period, the overall parasitaemic trypanosome prevalence was 3\% (6/199), while the serological prevalence was 54.7\% (109/199). Both diagnostic tests revealed a predominance of T. vivax over T. congolense infections in N'Dama cattle. Sensitivity of the immunoassay was 83.3\%. In T. vivax-parasitaemic cattle, antibodies persisted for 4-6 months after the parasite was detected by BCT. A significantly higher overall mean PCV level was observed in blood samples obtained from cattle found, in any particular month, negative by BCT and ELISA, compared with those blood samples from animals responding serologically positively for anti-trypanosome antibodies. Likewise, mean DWG was significantly higher in cattle found negative for both tests in comparison to animals presenting detectable anti-trypanosome antibodies and those detected positive by both tests. A significant negative relationship was observed between pp values and PCV levels in animals seropositive for T. vivax and/or T. congolense. Similarly, a negative relationship was observed between DWGs and pp values. PCV levels were significantly positively correlated with DWGs. It was concluded that serological screening could provide useful information complementary to that obtained by the use of BCT not only to assess more accurately the trypanosomal status of cattle populations, but also to evaluate the effects of trypanosome infection on animal health and productivity and estimate the trypanosomosis risk.},

The geometric means of these vectors varied by trap, location, and height. WNV was isolated from Cx. neavei and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected by pigeon-baited traps within the canopy, CO2-CDC traps within the canopy and at the ground. USUV was isolated only from Cx. neavei collected by pigeon-baited traps and CO2-CDC traps within the canopy.

The F(2) linkage map was incongruent in most respects with the established map for Aaa. Furthermore, no increased recombination was detected in F(5) offspring.

	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {The Aedes aegypti mosquito is one of the most significant transmission vectors of dengue viruses. RNA silencing has been shown to act as an effective antiviral mechanism and as an innate immune response to protect adult mosquitoes from alphavirus and flavivirus infection and unregulated dissemination. It is generally believed that a molecular coevolutionary arms race exists between viruses and their arthropod hosts. Research has demonstrated that the rate of evolution of amino acid sequences is substantially elevated in antiviral RNA interference (siRNA) genes (Dicer2, Ago2, R2D2) in Drosophila compared to the genes in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway (Dicer1, Ago1, R3D1) and to the average rate in the entire genome. To quantify Ae. aegypti evolution in the siRNA genes, we generated sequence data for most of the exon regions of ago2, dcr2, r2d2, ago1, dcr1 and r3d1 in 104 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from three populations from Mexico, two populations from Senegal, Africa, and one population from Thailand. Collection sites were chosen based on their diverse geographic distribution, vector competence for DENV-2 and Ae. aegypti subspecies. The intraspecific rates of siRNA and miRNA gene evolution were then compared. The rates of amino acid evolution and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide differences were determined to be significantly elevated in siRNA genes (ago2: 0.306, dcr2: 0.230, r2d2: 0.221) compared to miRNA genes (ago1: 0.039, dcr1: 0.193, r2d1: 0.131). Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood demonstrated substantial variation in all genes and distinct clade formation with one Ae. aegypti collection from Senegal, Africa. Likelihood ratio test for positive selection also identified a substantially higher number of positively selected sites in the siRNA genes. Even though the collection sites were selected based on Ae. aegypti's role in arbovirus transmission, our findings do not conclusively demonstrate a role for arbovirus infection in driving RNAi gene evolution rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2005, the Government of Senegal embarked on a campaign to eliminate a Glossina palpalis gambiensis population from the Niayes area ({\textasciitilde} 1000 km(2)) under the umbrella of the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). The project was considered an ecologically sound approach to intensify cattle production. The elimination strategy includes a suppression phase using insecticide impregnated targets and cattle, and an elimination phase using the sterile insect technique, necessary to eliminate tsetse in this area., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three main cattle farming systems were identified: a traditional system using trypanotolerant cattle and two "improved" systems using more productive cattle breeds focusing on milk and meat production. In improved farming systems herd size was 45\% lower and annual cattle sales were 250 (s.d. 513) per head as compared to 74 (s.d. 38) per head in traditional farming systems (p{\textless}10-3). Tsetse distribution significantly impacted the occurrence of these farming systems (p = 0.001), with 34\% (s.d. 4\%) and 6\% (s.d. 4\%) of improved systems in the tsetse-free and tsetse-infested areas, respectively. We calculated the potential increases of cattle sales as a result of tsetse elimination considering two scenarios, i.e. a conservative scenario with a 2\% annual replacement rate from traditional to improved systems after elimination, and a more realistic scenario with an increased replacement rate of 10\% five years after elimination. The final annual increase of cattle sales was estimated at {\textasciitilde} 2800/km(2) for a total cost of the elimination campaign reaching {\textasciitilde} 6400/km(2)., CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite its high cost, the benefit-cost analysis indicated that the project was highly cost-effective, with Internal Rates of Return (IRR) of 9.8\% and 19.1\% and payback periods of 18 and 13 years for the two scenarios, respectively. In addition to an increase in farmers' income, the benefits of tsetse elimination include a reduction of grazing pressure on the ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is one of the most studied mosquito species, and the principal vector of several arboviruses pathogenic to humans. Recently failure to oviposit, low fecundity, and poor egg-to-adult survival were observed when Ae. aegypti from Senegal (SenAae) West Africa were crossed with Ae. aegypti (Aaa) from outside of Africa, and in SenAae intercrosses. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses indicated rearrangements on chromosome 1, and pericentric inversions on chromosomes 2 and 3. Herein, high throughput sequencing (HTS) of exon-enriched libraries was used to compare chromosome-wide genetic diversity among Aaa collections from rural Thailand and Mexico, a sylvatic collection from southeastern Senegal (PK10), and an urban collection from western Senegal (Kaolack). Sex-specific polymorphisms were analyzed in Thailand and PK10 to assess genetic differences between sexes. Expected heterozygosity was greatest in SenAae FST distributions of 15,735 genes among all six pairwise comparisons of the four collections indicated that Mexican and Thailand collections are genetically similar, while FST distributions between PK10 and Kaolack were distinct. All four comparisons of SenAae with Aaa indicated extreme differentiation. FST was uniform between sexes across all chromosomes in Thailand, but were different, especially on the sex autosome 1, in PK10. These patterns correlate with the reproductive isolation noted earlier. We hypothesize that cryptic Ae. aegypti taxa may exist in West Africa, and the large genic differences between Aaa and SenAae detected in the present study have accumulated over a long period following the evolution of chromosome rearrangements in allopatric populations that subsequently cause reproductive isolation when these populations became sympatric.

	abstract = {The effects of experimental Trypanosoma congolense infection in Gambian N'dama and Gobra zebu cattle on number of naturally-occurring adult ticks attaching were studied. An indirect fluorescent antibody test was performed to detect serological prevalence of Cowdria ruminantium antibody. The intravenously imposed trypanosome infection did not result in significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) differences in Amblyomma variegatum and Hyalomma spp. infestations between control and infected N'dama cattle. Control N'damas carried significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) lower numbers of A. variegatum and Hyalomma spp. than the control zebus. Serological frequency of C. ruminantium antibody was similar in both control or infected N'dama and in control or infected zebu cattle. No deaths occurred among N'dama cattle, while all six trypanosome infected zebus progressively died within nine weeks post-infection but trypanosomosis was excluded as the primary cause of death. Examined Giemsa-stained blood smears were negative for the presence of tick-borne micro-organisms. Four positive cases of cowdriosis were identified during post-mortem examination. It was concluded that N'damas, even when submitted to trypanosome infection, react consistently better than Gobra zebus to tick attachment. These results emphasize the benefits of rearing disease resistant cattle breeds, such as N'dama, in areas where risks of trypanosomosis and cowdriosis coexist.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is a widespread pathogen maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds with occasional spill-over into dead-end hosts such as horses and humans. Migratory birds are believed to play an important role in its dissemination from and to the Palaearctic area, as well as its local dispersion between wintering sites. The Djoudj Park, located in Senegal, is a major wintering site for birds migrating from Europe during the study period (Sept. 2008- Jan. 2009). In this work, we studied the seasonal feeding behaviour dynamics of the potential WNV mosquito vectors at the border of the Djoudj Park, using a reference trapping method (CDC light CO2-baited traps) and two host-specific methods (horse- and pigeon-baited traps). Blood meals of engorged females were analysed to determine their origin., RESULTS: Results indicated that Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. neavei may play a key role in the WNV transmission dynamics, the latter being the best candidate bridging-vector species between mammals and birds. Moreover, the attractiveness of pigeon- and horse-baited traps for Cx. neavei and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus varied with time. Finally, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was only active when the night temperature was above 20degreeC, whereas Cx. neavei was active throughout the observation period., CONCLUSIONS: Cx. neavei and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus are the main candidate vectors for the transmission of WNV in the area. The changes in host attractiveness might be related to variable densities of the migratory birds during the trapping period. We discuss the importance of these results on the risk of WNV transmission in horses and humans.},

	abstract = {During the rainy season 2003, an entomological survey was undertaken in the Sahelian bioclimatic zone of the Ferlo area in northern Senegal, in order to evaluate the degree of interaction between Rift valley fever (RVF) virus vectors and domestic animals and to determine the role of natural vertebrate hosts in the transmission and maintenance cycle. The study of vector-host contact was carried out under bed net traps using man, cow, sheep, chicken as bait whereas the RVFV vectors-vertebrate host interactions were studied through the analysis by an ELISA technique of the origin of the blood meals from naturally engorged females collected by aspiration. Blood meals sources were determined using a set of eight antibodies. Overall, the different known RVFV vectors (Culex poicilipes, Aedes vexans and Aedes ochraceus) were opportunistic although the bovine-baited net was, as far the more effective trap with 53.6\% of collected mosquitoes. It was followed by the sheep-baited net (16.7\%), man-baited net (12.6\%) and chicken-baited net (11.6\%). The more effectiveness of the bovine-baited net confirms the degree of implication of this host in RVF epidemiology. The study of vector-hosts interactions in nature showed that among the 1,112 mosquito blood meals tested, 701 were identified of which 693 were from Aedes vexans. The percentage of non-reacting blood meal was 36.7\% whereas 16.9 \% of the blood meals were taken at least on two vertebrate hosts. Overall, 53.2\% of the blood meals from Ae. vexans were taken on equine, 18.6\% on bovines, 7.1\% on sheep and 0.6\% on human. No blood meal was taken on rodent. The greatest diversity was observed in August. These host feedings patterns show that although equine is known to play a minor role in RVF epidemiology a thorough attention should be made to this host with regard to the percentage of blood meals taken in this host. The low percentage of blood meals taken on human could probably explain the low human infection rate observed up to now in Senegal. With the high percentage of non-reacting blood meals, our results also underline the necessity of an improvement of ELISA techniques and the use of more reliable tools as molecular markers for an exhaustive identification of vertebrates hosts involved in RVF epidemiological cycle.},

	abstract = {Odour baited traps have potential use in population surveillance of insect vectors of disease, and in some cases for vector population reduction. Established attractants for human host-seeking mosquitoes include a combination of CO(2) with L-lactic acid and ammonia, on top of which additional candidate compounds are being tested. In this field study in rural Gambia, using Latin square experiments with thorough randomization and replication, we tested nine different leading candidate combinations of chemical odorants for attractiveness to wild mosquitoes including anthropophilic malaria vectors, using modified Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) counterflow traps outside experimental huts containing male human sleepers. Highest catches of female mosquitoes, particularly of An. gambiae s.l. and Mansonia species, were obtained by incorporation of tetradecanoic acid. As additional carboxylic acids did not increase the trap catches further, this 'reference blend' (tetradecanoic acid with L-lactic acid, ammonia and CO(2)) was used in subsequent experiments. MM-X traps with this blend caught similar numbers of An. gambiae s.l. and slightly more Mansonia and Culex mosquitoes than a standard CDC light trap, and these numbers were not significantly affected by the presence or absence of human sleepers in the huts. Experiments with CO(2) produced from overnight yeast cultures showed that this organic source was effective in enabling trap attractiveness for all mosquito species, although at a slightly lower efficiency than obtained with use of CO(2) gas cylinders. Although further studies are needed to discover additional chemicals that increase attractiveness, as well as to optimise trap design and CO(2) source for broader practical use, the odour-baited traps described here are safe and effective for sampling host-seeking mosquitoes outdoors and can be incorporated into studies of malaria vector ecology.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the major vector of the Dengue and Yellow Fever flaviviruses. The subspecies Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa) has a global distribution while Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) is limited to Sub-Saharan Africa. These two subspecies differ in flavivirus vector competence, which is a partially genetically controlled trait. Diversity within vector competence associated genes can be maintained by reduced gene flow. To identify genome regions with reduced gene flow, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by whole genome resequencing on two replicates of 25 field collected individuals from Thailand, Mexico, and 2 locations in Senegal using the Illumina platform. Sequence libraries were aligned to the 18,769 VectorBase transcripts, including introns, of known chromosomal location (301 x 106 nucleotides). LOD scores between populations were corrected for by subtracting LOD differences between replicates. We identified 23 regions across all three chromosomes associated with large genetic distances between Aaa from Thailand or Mexico and Aaf from Senegal. We also identified regions of genetic distance between males and females from Senegal, but the average LOD score between males and females was half that compared to between Senegal and Thailand. In addition, we sequenced 90 genes of known chromosomal location in 10 field collected individuals from Senegal (Aaf), and 10 field collected individuals worldwide (Aaa). Regions of reduced gene flow across all three chromosomes between Aaa and Aaf were identified by calculating Fst values, sequence divergence (dxy), nucleotide diversity (pi), and dN/dS with the program DNASp. These results suggest that the amount of gene flow between Aaa and Aaf is not uniform, but instead clustered in specific genome regions. Genome regions with reduced gene flow between Aaa and Aaf could be maintaining differences in vector competence phenotypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti, the "yellow fever mosquito", is the primary vector to humans of the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1-4) and yellow fever virus (YFV) and is a known vector of Chikungunya virus. There are two recognized subspecies of Ae. aegypti sensu latu (s.l.): the presumed ancestral form, Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf), a primarily sylvan mosquito in sub-Saharan Africa, and Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa), found globally in tropical and subtropical regions typically in association with humans. The designation of Ae. aegypti s.l. subspecies arose from observations made in East Africa in the late 1950s that the frequency of pale "forms" of Ae. aegypti was higher in populations in and around human dwellings than in those of the nearby bush. But few studies have been made of Ae. aegypti s.l. in West Africa. To address this deficiency we have been studying the population genetics, subspecies composition and vector competence for DENV-2 of Ae. aegypti s.l. in Senegal., METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population genetic analysis of gene flow was conducted among 1,040 Aedes aegypti s.l. from 19 collections distributed across the five phytogeographic regions of Senegal. Adults lacking pale scales on their first abdominal tergite were classified as Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) following the original description of the subspecies and the remainder were classified as Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa). There was a clear northwest-southeast cline in the abundance of Aaa and Aaf. Collections from the northern Sahelian region contained only Aaa while southern Forest gallery collections contained only Aaf. The two subspecies occurred in sympatry in four collections north of the Gambia in the central Savannah region and Aaa was a minor component of two collections from the Forest gallery area. Mosquitoes from 11 collections were orally challenged with DENV-2 virus. In agreement with the early literature, Aaf had significantly lower vector competence than Aaa. Among pure Aaa collections, the disseminated infection rate (DIR) was 73.9\% with a midgut infection barrier (MIB) rate of 6.8\%, and a midgut escape barrier (MEB) rate of 19.3\%, while among pure Aaf collections, DIR = 34.2\%, MIB rate = 7.4\%, and MEB rate = 58.4\%. Allele and genotype frequencies were analyzed at 11 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci using allele specific PCR and melting curve analysis. In agreement with a published isozyme gene flow study in Senegal, only a small and statistically insignificant percentage of the variance in allele frequencies was associated with subspecies., CONCLUSIONS: These results add to our understanding of the global phylogeny of Aedes aegypti s.l., suggesting that West African Aaa and Aaf are monophyletic and that Aaa evolved in West Africa from an Aaf ancestor.},

	abstract = {Isolated tsetse populations constitute a target for tsetse control programmes in endemic countries, since their isolation, if demonstrated, allows control without reinvasion risk from neighbouring populations. Population genetic parameters, such as the fixation index, have proven useful to assess isolation status, and should also give important information on the divergence time since isolation. We gathered results obtained from different datasets regarding several examples of putatively totally isolated tsetse populations of different tsetse species: Glossina palpalis gambiensis in Guinea, in the Niayes of Senegal, and in the sacred wood of Bama in Burkina Faso; G. tachinoides from Bitou and Pama in South-East Burkina Faso. The different levels of isolation were compared to differentiation between the two subspecies G. p. gambiensis and G. p. palpalis which both occur allopatrically along the Comoe River in Ivory Coast. We also use some historical evidence to calibrate differentiation speed and give estimates of time since separation for the different cases studied. Discrepancies mostly come from underestimate of effective population sizes, and we propose improving sampling design and genetic markers quality to circumvent such caveats.

These assays were first optimized and screened for specificity and sensitivity. Then, they were used to study a total of 548 blood samples and 97 ticks collected from Equidae in four sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, and Djibouti) and France (Marseille and Corsica). DNA of piroplasms was detected in 162 of 548 (29.5\%) blood samples and in 9 of 97 (9.3\%) ticks. The highest prevalence in blood samples was observed in Chad in 2016 with 72.9\% positivity rate. Sequencing allowed the identification of four species of piroplasms, including two potentials new species. Theileria equi was mainly found. The highest prevalence was observed in Senegal (14 positive out of 23, 60.87\%). Babesia caballi was detected in one horse in Senegal. Two new potential Theileria species were detected: Theileria sp.

In Dakar, some malaria cases are autochthonous but parasite rates and incidences of clinical malaria attacks have been recorded at low levels. Ecological heterogeneity of malaria transmission was investigated in Dakar, in order to characterize the Anopheles breeding sites in the city and to study the dynamics of larval density and adult aggressiveness in ten characteristically different urban areas. Methods. Ten study areas were sampled in Dakar and Pikine. Mosquitoes were collected by human landing collection during four nights in each area (120 person-nights). The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CSP) index was measured by ELISA and the entomological inoculation rates (EIR) were calculated. Open water collections in the study areas were monitored weekly for physico-chemical characterization and the presence of anopheline larvae. Adult mosquitoes and hatched larvae were identified morphologically and by molecular methods. Results. In September-October 2007, 19,451 adult mosquitoes were caught among which, 1,101 were Anopheles gambiae s.l. The Human Biting Rate ranged from 0.1 bites per person per night in Yoff Village to 43.7 in Almadies. Seven out of 1,101 An. gambiae s.l. were found to be positive for P. falciparum (CSP index = 0.64\%). EIR ranged from 0 infected bites per person per year in Yoff Village to 16.8 in Almadies. The An. gambiae complex population was composed of Anopheles arabiensis (94.8\%) and Anopheles melas (5.2\%). None of the An. melas were infected with P. falciparum. Of the 54 water collection sites monitored, 33 (61.1\%) served as anopheline breeding sites on at least one observation. No An. melas was identified among the larval samples. Some physico-chemical characteristics of water bodies were associated with the presence/absence of anopheline larvae and with larval density. A very close parallel between larval and adult densities was found in six of the ten study areas. Conclusion. The results provide evidence of malaria transmission in downtown Dakar and its surrounding suburbs. Spatial heterogeneity of human biting rates was very marked and malaria transmission was highly focal. In Dakar, mean figures for transmission would not provide a comprehensive picture of the entomological situation; risk evaluation should therefore be undertaken on a small scale. © 2009 Machault et al.},

	abstract = {Studying the behaviour and trophic preferences of mosquitoes is an important step in understanding the exposure of vertebrate hosts to vector-borne diseases. In the case of human malaria, transmission increases when mosquitoes feed more on humans than on other animals. Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of vectors and their feeding preferences is essential for improving vector control measures. In this study, we investigated the feeding behaviour of Anopheles mosquitoes at two sites in the Sudanian areas of Senegal where transmission is low following the implementation of vector control measures. Blood-fed mosquitoes were collected monthly from July to November 2022 by pyrethrum spray catches in sleeping rooms of almost all houses in Dielmo and Ndiop villages, and blood meals were identified as from human, bovine, ovine, equine and chicken by ELISA. Species from the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. The types and numbers of potential domestic animal hosts were recorded in each village. The Human Blood Index (HBI) and the Manly Selection Ratio (MSR) were calculated to determine whether hosts were selected in proportion to their abundance. Spatio-temporal variation in HBI was examined using the Moran's index. A total of 1251 endophilic Anopheles females were collected in 115 bedrooms, including 864 blood fed females of 6 species. An. arabiensis and An. funestus were predominant in Dielmo and Ndiop, respectively. Of the 864 blood meals tested, 853 gave a single host positive result mainly on bovine, equine, human, ovine and chicken in decreasing order in both villages. Overall, these hosts were not selected in proportion to their abundance. The human host was under-selected, highlighting a marked zoophily for the vectors. Over time and space, the HBI were low with no obvious trend, with higher and lower values observed in each of the five months at different points in each village. These results highlight the zoophilic and exophagic behaviour of malaria vectors. This behaviour is likely to be a consequence of the distribution and use of LLINs in both villages and may increase risk of residual outdoor transmission. This underlines the need to study the feeding host profile of outdoor resting populations and how domestic animals may influence malaria epidemiology in order to tailor effective malaria vector control strategies in the two villages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Host-vector contact is a key factor in vectorial capacity assessment and thus the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), an emerging zoonotic disease of interest in West Africa. The knowledge of the host-feeding patterns of vector species constitutes a key element in the assessment of their epidemiological importance in a given environment. The aim of this work was to identify the blood meal origins of the mosquito Aedes vexans arabiensis, the main vector of RVF virus in the Ferlo pastoral ecosystem of Senegal., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Engorged female mosquitoes were collected in Younoufere in the pastoral ecosystem in the Ferlo region during the 2014 rainy season. CO2-baited CDC light traps were set at six points for two consecutive nights every month from July to November. Domestic animals present around traps were identified and counted for each trapping session. Blood meal sources of engorged mosquitoes were identified using a vertebrate-specific multiplexed primer set based on cytochrome b. Blood meal sources were successfully identified for 319 out of 416 blood-fed females (76.68\%), of which 163 (51.1\%) were single meals, 146 (45.77\%) mixed meals from two different hosts and 10 (3.13\%) mixed meals from three different hosts. Aedes vexans arabiensis fed preferentially on mammals especially on horse compared to other hosts (FR = 46.83). Proportions of single and mixed meals showed significant temporal and spatial variations according to the availability of the hosts., CONCLUSION: Aedes vexans arabiensis shows an opportunistic feeding behavior depending on the host availability. This species fed preferentially on mammals especially on horses (primary hosts) and ruminants (secondary hosts).},

	abstract = {Today the trypanosomiasis always represents public health problems in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa, even if it is recognized in a general way that the situation clearly improved following the example of West Africa. However the situation under area remains fuzzy since very little, even not of information are available for 6 countries, as Senegal which formerly sheltered active hearths of trypanosomiasis. Besides many areas of West Africa were not visited since independences. In Senegal the history of the HAT goes back to the colonial period. The first cases of trypanosomiasis were announced on the Small Coast by Sice which describes them under the name of "Nelawane". Many cases were observed of 1900 the day before independences, in the areas contaminated like the Delta of Senegal, Niayes, the Small Coast, Casamance and Eastern Senegal. The disease had almost disappeared in the Sixties, at which time she was then regarded as residual. The last case recorded in Senegal goes back to 1977 in a 18 year old young man born in Mbour an old active hearth. Since then, no case of disease of the sleep was announced, but also no program of epidemiologic monitoring was set up. Only a project of fight against the glossines in Niayes and part of small the east coast in the course of execution. However after having revisited the principal historical hearths of Senegal, we studied the distribution and the densities of glossines via the degree of development of hydraulic works as well as the hydrographic network and pluviometry in the areas formerly contaminated by the HAT. The analysis of these various factors besides the migratory bond with the infected countries made it possible to identify the areas at the risk of HAT namely: the Low one and High Casamance, the mouth of Sine Saloum, the zone of Kedougou and Niayes. Thus a reactualization of the epidemiologic and entomological data is essential.},

In Senegal, a purely sylvatic form is found in the forest gallery areas and a domestic form is found in the villages in savannah and sahelian areas and in urban areas. Using allozymes, we analyzed the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations differing in their ecological characteristics. Populations from Senegal were significantly structured but with a low level of genetic differentiation. Ae. aegypti from the "domestic" populations show a decreased genetic diversity and a lower genetic differentiation compared with "sylvatic" populations. These findings suggest that environmental conditions, ecological factors, and human activities may impact the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations in Senegal.},

	abstract = {Aedes vittatus (Bigot) mosquito is a voracious biter of humans and has a geographical distribution throughout tropical Asia, Africa and the Mediterranean region of Europe. It is predominantly a rock-hole breeder, though it can breed in diverse macro-and micro-habitats. The mosquito plays an important role in the maintenance and transmission of yellow fever (YFV), dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses. It has been implicated as an important vector of YFV in several African countries as evidenced by repeated virus isolations from the mosquito and its potential to transmit the virus experimentally. Similarly, DENV-2 has been isolated from wild caught Ae. vittatus mosquitoes in Senegal, Africa which has been shown to circulate the virus in sylvatic populations without causing human infection. Experimental studies have shown replication of the virus at a low scale in naturally infected mosquitoes while high rate of infection and dissemination have been reported in parenterally infected mosquitoes. Natural isolation of ZIKV has been reported from Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire from these mosquitoes. They were found highly competent to transmit the virus experimentally and the transmission rate is at par with Ae. leuteocephalus, the primary vector of ZIKV. A few CHIKV isolations have also been reported from the mosquitoes in Senegal and other countries in Africa. Experimental studies have demonstrated high susceptibility, early dissemination and efficient transmission of CHIKV by Ae. vittatus mosquitoes. The mosquitoes with their high susceptibility and competence to transmit important viruses, viz. YFV, DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV pose a major threat to public health due to their abundance and anthropophilic behaviour.},

	abstract = {Background: The influence of environmental and climatic factors on malaria vector bionomics and transmission is an important topic in the context of climatic change particularly at macro-geographical level. Sahelian areas could be particularly affected due to heterogeneous features including high inter-annual variability in rainfall and others associated parameters. Therefore, baseline information on the impact of environmental and climatic factors on malaria transmission at micro-geographical level is required for vector risk management and implementation of control strategies. Methods: Malaria vectors were collected indoors by pyrethrum spray catches in 14 villages belonging to 4 different landscape classes (wooded savanna, shrubby savanna, bare soils and steppe) in the sylvo-pastoral area of Senegal. Plasmodium falciparum infection rates were determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: An. arabiensis was the predominant species in all landscape classes and was the only species collected at the end of the rainy season excepted in villages located in bare soils where it cohabited with An. coluzzii. Mean temperature and relative humidity showed similar variations in all the landscape classes covered whereas rainfall was more heterogeneous in terms of pattern, frequency and amount. The mean densities of An. arabiensis displayed high seasonal differences with peaks observed in August or September. A positive non-significant correlation was observed between An. arabiensis densities for rainfall and humidity whereas a negative non-significant correlation was reported for temperature. Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes were detected only in wooded savanna and bare soils villages. Conclusions: These observations suggest key roles played by landscape classes and rainfall in malaria vector densities, infection rates and malaria transmission that could be more pronounced in villages situated in wooded savanna and bare soils. Due to the close relationship between environmental and meteorological parameters in this Sahelian region, additional studies on the impact of these parameters are required to further ascertain their association with entomological parameters involved in malaria transmission. From the public health point of view, such information could be useful for human population settlements as well as for monitoring and modelling purposes giving early warning system for implementation of interventions in these unstable transmission zones.},

The objective of this study was to collect and to identify O. sonrai ticks and to investigate the micro-organisms associated with them. In 2019, an investigation of burrows within human dwellings was conducted in 17 villages in the Niakhar area and in 15 villages in the Sine-Saloum area in the Fatick region of Senegal. Ticks collected from the burrows were identified morphologically and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Micro-organism screening was performed by bacteria-specific qPCR and some identifications were made by standard PCR and gene sequencing. O. sonrai ticks were found in 100\% (17/17) of the villages surveyed in the Niakhar area and in 66\% (10/15) of the villages in the Sine-Saloum area. A total of 1275 soft tick specimens were collected from small mammal burrows. The ticks collected were morphologically identified as O. sonrai. About 20\% (259/1275) of the specimens were also submitted to MALDI-TOF MS for identification. Among the resulting MS profiles, 87\% (139/159) and 95\% (95/100) were considered good quality specimens, preserved in alcohol and silica gel, respectively. All spectra of good quality were tested against our MALDI-TOF MS arthropod spectra database and identified as O. sonrai species, corroborating the morphological classification. The carriage of four micro-organisms was detected in the ticks with a high prevalence of Bartonella spp., Anaplasmataceae, and Borrelia spp. of 35, 28, and 26\%, respectively, and low carriage of Coxiella burnetii (2\%). This study highlights the level of tick infestation in domestic burrows, the inventory of pathogens associated with the O. sonrai tick, and the concern about the potential risk of tick involvement in the transmission of these pathogens in Senegal.},

	abstract = {The inland floodwater mosquito Aedes vexans (Meigen, 1830) is a competent vector of numerous arthropod-borne viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus (Phenuiviridae) and Zika virus (Flaviviridae). Aedes vexans spp. have widespread Afrotropical distribution and are common European cosmopolitan mosquitoes. We examined the virome of Ae. vexans arabiensis samples from Barkedji village, Senegal, with small RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and RT-PCR screening. We identified a novel 9494 nt iflavirus (Picornaviridae) designated here as Aedes vexans iflavirus (AvIFV). Annotation of the AvIFV genome reveals a 2782 amino acid polyprotein with iflavirus protein domain architecture and typical iflavirus 5' internal ribosomal entry site and 3' poly-A tail. Aedes vexans iflavirus is most closely related to a partial virus sequence from Venturia canescens (a parasitoid wasp) with 56.77\% pairwise amino acid identity. Analysis of AvIFV-derived small RNAs suggests that AvIFV is targeted by the exogenous RNA interference pathway but not the PIWI-interacting RNA response, as similar to 60\% of AvIFV reads corresponded to 21 nt Dicer-2 virus-derived small RNAs and the 24-29 nt AvIFV read population did not exhibit a "ping-pong" signature. The RT-PCR screens of archival and current (circa 2011-2020) Ae. vexans arabiensis laboratory samples and wild-caught mosquitoes from Barkedji suggest that AvIFV is ubiquitous in these mosquitoes. Further, we screened wild-caught European Ae. vexans samples from Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden, all of which tested negative for AvIFV RNA.

In this study, we noted the presence of Occidentia species, designated as Occidentia-like species, in a soft tick O. turicata americanus. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the two genetic markers, 16S rRNA and groEL confirmed the presence of Occidentia-like species in O. turicata americanus ticks. The Occidentia-like species was noted to be present in all developmental stages of O. turicata americanus and in different tick tissues including ovaries, synganglion, guts and salivary gland. The levels of Occidentia-like species 16S rRNA transcripts were noted to be significantly higher in ovaries than in a gut tissue. In addition, Occidentia-like species groEL expression was noted to be significantly higher in tick synganglion than in ovaries and gut tissues. Furthermore, levels of Occidentia-like species 16S rRNA transcripts increased significantly upon O. turicata americanus blood feeding. Taken together, our study not only shows that Occidentia-like species is present in O. turicata americanus but also suggests that this bacterium may play a role in tick-bacteria interactions.},

Specific IgE and IgG4 responses increased during rainy season of high exposure to Aedes bites. In addition, the evolution of anti-saliva isotype levels during the rainy season presented spatial heterogeneity between the studied villages.

	abstract = {Sylvatic arboviruses have been isolated in Senegal over the last 50 years. The ecological drivers of the pattern and frequency of virus infection in these species are largely unknown. We used time series analysis and Bayesian hierarchical count modeling on a long-term arbovirus dataset to test associations between mosquito abundance, weather variables, and the frequency of isolation of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. We found little correlation between mosquito abundance and viral isolations. Rainfall was a negative predictor of dengue virus (DENV) isolation but a positive predictor of Zika virus isolation. Temperature was a positive predictor of yellow fever virus (YFV) isolations but a negative predictor of DENV isolations. We found slight interference between viruses, with DENV negatively associated with concurrent YFV isolation and YFV negatively associated with concurrent isolation of chikungunya virus. These findings begin to characterize some of the ecological associations of sylvatic arboviruses with each other and climate and mosquito abundance.

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal rainfall variability is a key parameter controlling the dynamics of mosquitoes/vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Rift Valley fever (RVF), or dengue. Impacts from rainfall heterogeneity at small scales (i.e., 1-10 km) on the risk of epidemics (i.e., host bite rate or number of bites per host and per night) must be thoroughly evaluated. A model with hydrological and entomological components for risk prediction of the RVF zoonosis is proposed. The model predicts the production of two mosquito species within a 45 km X 45 km area in the Ferlo region, Senegal. The three necessary steps include 1) best rainfall estimation on a small scale, 2) adequate forcing of a simple hydrological model leading to pond dynamics (ponds are the primary larvae breeding grounds), and 3) best estimate of mosquito life cycles obtained from the coupled entomological model. The sensitivity of the model to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of rainfall is first tested using high-resolution rain fields from a weather radar. The need for high-resolution rain data is thus demonstrated. Several high-resolution satellite rainfall products are evaluated in the region of interest using a dense rain gauge network. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42, version 6 (TMPA-3B42V6), and 3B42 in real time (TMPA-3B42RT); Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) in near-real time (GSMaP-NRT) and Moving Vector with Kalman version (GSMaP-MVK); African Rainfall Estimation Algorithm, version 2.0 (RFE 2.0); Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH); and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) are tested and finally corrected using a probability matching method. The corrected products are then used as forcing to the coupled model over the 2003-10 period. The predicted number and size of ponds and their dynamics are greatly improved compared to the model forced only by a single gauge. A more realistic spatiotemporal distribution of the host bite rate of the RVF vectors is thus expected.},

	abstract = {In Senegal, a project has been undertaken to eradicate a population of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis) from a prime area for intensifying livestock production--the coastal region of Niayes. The project is intended to remove the constraint of trypanosomosis and allow the ecological intensification of cattle production. A cross-sectional analysis of ten case studies was the inductive phase of an assessment to gauge the impact of removing trypanosomosis on livestock production strategies. The methodology used was comprehensive analysis, with participatory epidemiology tools to understand farmers' rationales. The authors analysed the strategies of three main types of livestock producer (agro-pastoralists, mixed crop/livestock farmers and intensive dairy farmers). The strategies were in line with the farmers' goals and their ability to mobilise the socio-technical network. The risk management of trypanosomosis has been incorporated into livestock management practices through the use of trypanotolerant breeds, medical prophylaxis or placing livestock in low-risk areas. Removing the risk of disease would therefore have a major impact on decisions about the composition and strategic direction of herds. This change in the animal health environment would steer livestock production along different routes of intensification in a highly competitive environment. The indicators of innovation capacity revealed by this study will be used to quantitatively monitor various change scenarios, taking livestock producers' reasoning into account, in order to assess the socio-economic impact of eradicating the tsetse fly population in this area. The methodology presented in the study can be used to understand the impact of controlling other vector-borne infections on the innovation dynamics of livestock producers.},

	abstract = {The use of efficient mosquito sampling methods in vector surveillance programs is crucial to inform control actions and prevent outbreaks. amongst existing trapping methods, the BG sentinel trap is widely used for collecting mosquitoes from the subgenus Stegomyia. However, studies state that the BG-sentinel trap underestimates the relative abundance of mosquito vectors. In this study, we used mice to enhance the effectiveness of the BG-sentinel trap to collect Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and follow the species' daily abundance under local conditions. The Latin square method was used to compare different combinations in three different seasons. Of the 35,107 mosquitoes collected, Ae. aegypti (53.82\%) and Culex quinquefasciatus (46.07\%) were dominant. The combination of BG-Lure + 3 mice captured more Ae. aegypti individuals (apparent density per trap/day (ADT = 187.65 +/- 133.53; p {\textless} 0.001) followed by the 3 mice-baited BG-sentinel trap (ADT = 163.47 +/- 117.32), the BG-sentinel trap without attractant (ADT = 74.15 +/- 117.07) and the BG-sentinel trap + BG-Lure (ADT = 47.1 +/- 115.91). Aedes aegypti showed two peaks of activity in the day, one following the sunrise and one before the sunset, influenced by temperature and relative humidity. Our study suggests the use of mice to enhance the efficiency of the BG-Sentinel trap to catch Ae. aegypti. However, its application in large scale entomological monitoring programs should be difficult because of ethical and operational constraints. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. Method(s): In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 degreeC and 40, 50, 60, and 75 \% relative humidity (rH), 30 degreeC and 60 \% rH and 35 degreeC and 60 \% rH. Result(s): The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 degreeC was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 \% had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 degreeC. Conclusion(s): We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).},

In Senegal, control activities are mainly limited to mitigation of epidemics, with limited information available for Ae. aegypti populations. A better understanding of the current Ae. aegypti susceptibility status to various insecticides and relevant resistance mechanisms involved is needed for the implementation of effective vector control strategies. The present study focuses on the detection of insecticide resistance and reveals the related mechanisms in Ae. aegypti populations from Senegal. Bioassays were performed on Ae. aegypti adults from nine Senegalese localities (Matam, Louga, Barkedji, Ziguinchor, Mbour, Fatick, Dakar, Kedougou and Touba). Mosquitoes were exposed to four classes of insecticides using the standard WHO protocols. Resistance mechanisms were investigated by genotyping for pyrethroid target site resistance mutations (V1016G, V1016I, F1534C and S989P) and measuring gene expression levels of key detoxification genes (CYP6BB2, CYP9J26, CYP9J28, CYP9J32, CYP9M6, CCEae3a and GSTD4). All collected populations were resistant to DDT and carbamates except for the ones in Matam (Northern region). Resistance to permethrin was uniformly detected in mosquitoes from all areas. Except for Barkedji and Touba, all populations were characterized by a susceptibility to 0.75\% Permethrin. Susceptibility to type II pyrethroids was detected only in the Southern regions (Kedougou and Ziguinchor). All mosquito populations were susceptible to 5\% Malathion, but only Kedougou and Matam mosquitoes were susceptible to 0.8\% Malathion. All populations were resistant to 0.05\% Pirimiphos-methyl, whereas those from Louga, Mbour and Barkedji, also exhibited resistance to 1\% Fenitrothion. None of the known target site pyrethroid resistance mutations was present in the mosquito samples included in the genotyping analysis (performed in {\textgreater} 1500 samples). In contrast, a remarkably high (20-70-fold) overexpression of major detoxification genes was observed, suggesting that insecticide resistance is mostly mediated through metabolic mechanisms. These data provide important evidence to support dengue vector control in Senegal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two concomitant dengue 3 (DEN-3) epidemics occurred in Cape Verde Archipelago and Senegal between September and October 2009. Aedes aegypti was identified as the vector of these epidemics as several DEN-3 virus strains were isolated from this species in both countries. The susceptibility to pyrethroids, organochlorine, organophosphates and carbamate was investigated in two field strains of Aedes aegypti from both countries using WHO diagnostic bioassay kits in order to monitor their the current status of insecticide susceptibility., FINDINGS: The two tested strains were highly resistant to DDT. The Cape Verde strain was found to be susceptible to all others tested insecticides except for propoxur 0.1\%, which needs further investigation. The Dakar strain was susceptible to fenitrothion 1\% and permethrin 0.75\%, but displayed reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and propoxur., CONCLUSIONS: As base-line results, our observations stress a careful management of insecticide use for the control of Ae. aegypti. Indeed, they indicate that DDT is no longer efficient for the control of Ae. aegypti populations in Cape Verde and Dakar and further suggest a thorough follow-up of propoxur susceptibility status in both sites and that of deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin in Ae. aegypti populations in Dakar. Thus, regular monitoring of susceptibility is greatly needed as well as the knowing if this observed resistance/susceptibility is focal or not and for observed resistance, the use of biochemical methods is needed with detailed comparison of resistance levels over a large geographic area., KEYWORDS: Aedes aegypti, Insecticides, Susceptibility, Cape Verde, Senegal.},

	abstract = {Background: Certain biting midges species of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors of virus to livestock worldwide. Culicoides larval ecology has remained overlooked because of difficulties to identify breeding sites, methodological constraints to collect samples and lack of morphological tools to identify field-collected individuals to the species level. After the 2007 unforeseen outbreaks of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) in Senegal (West Africa), there is a need to identify suitable and productive larval habitats in horse farms for the main Culicoides species to evaluate the implementation of vector control measures or preventive actions. Methods: We investigate twelve putative larval habitats (habitat types) of Culicoides inside and outside of three horse farms in the Niayes area of Senegal using a combination of flotation and emergence methods during four collection sessions. Results: Among the three studied horse farms, three habitat types were found positive for Culicoides larvae: pond edge, lake edge and puddle edge. A total of 1420 Culicoides individuals (519 male/901 female) belonging to ten species emerged from the substrate samples. Culicoides oxystoma (40 \%), C. similis (25 \%) and C. nivosus (24 \%) were the most abundant species and emerged from the three habitat types while C. kingi (5 \%) was only retrieved from lake edges and one male emerged from puddle edge. Culicoides imicola (1.7 \%) was found in low numbers and retrieved only from pond and puddle edges. Conclusions: Larval habitats identified were not species-specific. All positive larval habitats were found outside the horse farms. This study provides original baseline information on larval habitats of Culicoides species in Senegal in an area endemic for AHSV, in particular for species of interest in animal health. These data will serve as a point of reference for future investigations on larval ecology and larval control measures.},

The animals were not harbouring trypanosomes during a period of two to three months before exposure to periods of increasing density of tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans submorsitans) while grazing in savannah woodlands. The groups of cows were formed on the following basis: pregnant and lactating (lactating-pregnant) (Group 1, n = 143); pregnant and not lactating (dry-pregnant) (Group 2, n = 69); non-pregnant and lactating (lactating-open) (Group 3, n = 160); non-pregnant and not lactating (dry-open) (Group 4, n = 49).

Average PCV values for dry-pregnant cows (Group 2; 27.0\%) and dry-open cows (Group 4; 26.2\%), whether infected or not, were higher than those lactating (Group 1; 25.3\% and Group 3; 23.6\%). A body weight gain of 4.3 kg between the month of October and the following June was recorded for dry-pregnant cows (Group 2) whereas a weight loss of 16 kg occurred in the lactating-pregnant and lactating-open cows (Groups 1 and 3), with more severe losses recorded in infected than uninfected cows.

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-022-05536-9},
	abstract = {Background: Tsetse control is considered an effective and sustainable tactic for the control of cyclically transmitted trypanosomosis in the absence of effective vaccines and inexpensive, effective drugs. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal. For SIT, tsetse mass rearing is a major milestone that associated microbes can influence. Tsetse flies can be infected with microorganisms, including the primary and obligate Wigglesworthia glossinidia, the commensal Sodalis glossinidius, and Wolbachia pipientis. In addition, tsetse populations often carry a pathogenic DNA virus, the Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy virus (GpSGHV) that hinders tsetse fertility and fecundity. Interactions between symbionts and pathogens might affect the performance of the insect host. Methods: In the present study, we assessed associations of GpSGHV and tsetse endosymbionts under field conditions to decipher the possible bidirectional interactions in different Glossina species. We determined the co-infection pattern of GpSGHV and Wolbachia in natural tsetse populations. We further analyzed the interaction of both Wolbachia and GpSGHV infections with Sodalis and Wigglesworthia density using qPCR. Results: The results indicated that the co-infection of GpSGHV and Wolbachia was most prevalent in Glossina austeni and Glossina morsitans morsitans, with an explicit significant negative correlation between GpSGHV and Wigglesworthia density. GpSGHV infection levels {\textgreater} 10(3.31) seem to be absent when Wolbachia infection is present at high density ({\textgreater} 10(7.36)), suggesting a potential protective role of Wolbachia against GpSGHV. Conclusion: The result indicates that Wolbachia infection might interact (with an undefined mechanism) antagonistically with SGHV infection protecting tsetse fly against GpSGHV, and the interactions between the tsetse host and its associated microbes are dynamic and likely species specific; significant differences may exist between laboratory and field conditions.},

Larval and adult mosquitoes and malaria incidence were surveyed routinely in four 100-km2 areas either side of the Gambia River. Baseline data were collected in 2005. Microbial larvicide was applied to all water bodies by hand application with water-dispersible granular formulations and corn granules weekly from May to November in two areas in 2006 and in the other two areas in 2007 in a cross-over design. The intervention was associated with a reduction in habitats with late stage anopheline larvae and an 88\% reduction in larval densities (P {\textless} 0.001). The effect of the intervention on mosquito densities was not pronounced and was confounded by the distance of villages to the major breeding sites and year (P = 0.002). There was no reduction in clinical malaria or anemia. Ground applications of non-residual larvicides with simple equipment are not effective in riverine areas with extensive flooding, where many habitats are poorly demarcated, highly mobile, and inaccessible on foot.

	abstract = {Koutango virus is a Flavivirus from the family Togaviridae and has been shown to cause a mild disease in humans. Koutango is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, particularly Aedes spp. During a recent serosurvey of patients with acute febrile illness in Western Africa, we detected a high prevalence of Koutango exposure in people. To better characterize the potential for this emerging virus to be transmitted in the same urban cycle as dengue and yellow fever (which were also detected in the serosurvey), we undertook vector competence testing with strain DAK ArD 5443 which was isolated from Senegal in 1968. Aedes aegypti (Rockefeller) were orally exposed to a bloodmeal containing Koutango virus of 109 pfu/ml and subsequently tested for both abdomen infection and leg dissemination on days 3, 5, 7, and 11 post exposure. We found signifcant differences among these time points in both the infection and dissemination rates. Specifcally, the infection and dissemination rates at days post exposure 3 (.089,.02), 5 (.32,.08), 7 (.24,.17) were signifcantly different from day 11 post exposure (.83,.58). These data confrm that Ae. aegypti is a competent vector for Koutango virus and the transmission potential of this virus is complex, owing to the early- though slight- dissemination rates and the relatively high dissemination rates at 11 days post exposure. These data can be further used to evaluate the cumulative vectorial capacity of Koutango in Ae. aegypti as a measure of its overall transmission potential and better inform future surveillance efforts for this emerging pathogen.},

	abstract = {Dengue (DENV) and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) circulate in a sylvatic transmission cycle between non-human primates and arboreal Aedes spp. in Kedougou, Senegal, and several studies have shown a low incidence of infection by both sylvatic viruses in humans in West Africa as well. Although humans are probably infected by sylvatic vectors, the extent and mechanisms of contact between humans and sylvatic vectors remains unknown. To gain insight into the role of different mosquito species in both enzootic transmission in primates as well as spillover into humans, between 2009 and 2010 we monitored the distribution of a broad array of mosquito species in fve landscape classes (forests, savannahs, barren, agricultural, and villages) in the Kedougou area. Mosquito were collected monthly in each of the landscape classes from 18:00 to 21:00 hrs and identifed to species. Among 39,799 mosquitoes collected, the most and least abundant species were Ae. vittatus and Ae. aegypti, respectively. The abundance of Ae. vittatus, Ae. luteocephalus and Ae. aegypti peaked in June, while that of other species peaked twice between July and November, 2009. The preferred habitat of Ae. africanus, Ae. luteocephalus and Ae. taylori was the forest canopy, while the others species were distributed more evenly across the fve landscape classes. CHIKV was detected by real-time PCR assay and/or virus isolation in 39 pools of mosquitoes, including previously recognized (Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori, Ae. dalzieli, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. africanus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. neoafricanus, Ae. hirsutus, An. funestus, An. coustani, Ma. uniformis) and potentially new (Ae. metallicus, Ae. centropunctatus, Ae. hirsutus, An. domicola and Cx. poicilipes) CHIKV vectors. Infection rates showed temporal and spatial variation. No DENV was detected. Our fndings provide insight to the ecology of sylvatic vectors of DENV and CHIKV in a changing environment affected by urbanization and deforestation associated in part with mineral exploitation.},

	abstract = {Background: For malaria control in Africa it is crucial to characterise the dispersal of its most efficient vector, Anopheles gambiae, in order to target interventions and assess their impact spatially. Our study is, we believe, the first to present a statistical model of dispersal probability against distance from breeding habitat to human settlements for this important disease vector. Methods/Principal Findings: We undertook post-hoc analyses of mosquito catches made in The Gambia to derive statistical dispersal functions for An. gambiae sensu lato collected in 48 villages at varying distances to alluvial larval habitat along the River Gambia. The proportion dispersing declined exponentially with distance, and we estimated that 90\% of movements were within 1.7 km. Although a 'heavy-tailed' distribution is considered biologically more plausible due to active dispersal by mosquitoes seeking blood meals, there was no statistical basis for choosing it over a negative exponential distribution. Using a simple random walk model with daily survival and movements previously recorded in Burkina Faso, we were able to reproduce the dispersal probabilities observed in The Gambia. Conclusions/Significance: Our results provide an important quantification of the probability of An. gambiae s.l. dispersal in a rural African setting typical of many parts of the continent. However, dispersal will be landscape specific and in order to generalise to other spatial configurations of habitat and hosts it will be necessary to produce tractable models of mosquito movements for operational use. We show that simple random walk models have potential. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new empirical studies of An. gambiae survival and movements in different settings to drive this development.},

	abstract = {Flaviviruses are a diverse group of RNA viruses, which include the etiological agents of Zika, dengue and yellow fever that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Flaviviruses do not encode reverse transcriptase and cannot reverse transcribe into DNA, yet DNA sequences of flaviviruses are found both integrated in the chromosomes of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and as extrachromosomal sequences. We have previously examined the Ae. aegypti reference genome to identify flavivirus integrations and analyzed conservation of these sequences among whole-genome data of 464 Ae. aegypti collected across 10 countries globally. Here, we extended this analysis by identifying flavivirus sequences in these samples independently of the Ae. aegypti reference assembly. Our aim was to identify the complete set of viral sequences, including those absent in the reference genome, and their geographical distribution. We compared the identified sequences using BLASTn and applied machine learning methods to identify clusters of similar sequences. Apart from clusters of sequences that correspond to the four viral integration events that we had previously described, we identified 19 smaller clusters. The only cluster with a strong geographic association consisted of Cell-fusing agent virus-like sequences specific to Thailand. The remaining clusters did not have a geographic association and mostly consisted of near identical short sequences without strong similarity to any known flaviviral genomes. The short read sequencing data did not permit us to determine whether identified sequences were extrachromosomal or integrated into Ae. aegypti chromosomes. Our results suggest that Liverpool strain and field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have a similar variety of conserved flaviviral DNA, whose functional role should be investigated in follow-up studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although adult mosquito vectors of sylvatic arbovirus [yellow fever (YFV), dengue-2 (DENV-2) and chikungunya (CHIKV)] have been studied for the past 40 years in southeastern Senegal, data are still lacking on the ecology of larval mosquitoes in this area. In this study, we investigated the larval habitats of mosquitoes and characterized their seasonal and spatial dynamics in arbovirus foci., METHODS: We searched for wet microhabitats, classified in 9 categories, in five land cover classes (agriculture, forest, savannah, barren and village) from June, 2010 to January, 2011. Mosquito immatures were sampled monthly in up to 30 microhabitats of each category per land cover and bred until adult stage for determination., RESULTS: No wet microhabitats were found in the agricultural sites; in the remaining land covers immature stages of 35 mosquito species in 7 genera were sampled from 9 microhabitats (tree holes, fresh fruit husks, decaying fruit husks, puddles, bamboo holes, discarded containers, tires, rock holes and storage containers). The most abundant species was Aedes aegypti formosus, representing 30.2\% of the collections, followed by 12 species, representing each more than 1\% of the total, among them the arbovirus vectors Ae. vittatus (7.9\%), Ae. luteocephalus (5.7\%), Ae. taylori (5.0\%), and Ae. furcifer (1.3\%). Aedes aegypti, Cx. nebulosus, Cx. perfuscus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Er. chrysogster and Ae. vittatus were the only common species collected from all land covers. Aedes furcifer and Ae. taylori were collected in fresh fruit husks and tree holes. Species richness and dominance varied significantly in land covers and microhabitats. Positive associations were found mainly between Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus. A high proportion of potential enzootic vectors that are not anthropophilic were found in the larval mosquito fauna., CONCLUSIONS: In southeastern Senegal, Ae. furcifer and Ae. taylori larvae showed a more limited distribution among both land cover and microhabitat types than the other common species. Uniquely among vector species, Ae. aegypti formosus larvae occurred at the highest frequency in villages. Finally, a high proportion of the potential non-anthropophilic vectors were represented in the larval mosquito fauna, suggesting the existence of unidentified sylvatic arbovirus cycles in southeastern Senegal.},

Mosquito larvae and pupae were sampled along transects and in specific habitats in the central region of the country during the rainy seasons of 1996 and 1997. The sampling showed that the major breeding sites were located on the flooded alluvial soils bordering the river. The largest numbers of larvae were found during September, one month after the peak rains. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of specimens showed that Anopheles melas (Theobald) was the dominant species in the flooded areas (81.5\%), followed by A. gambiae sensu stricto (Giles) (18.0\%) and A. arabiensis (Patton) (0.5\%). By sampling in specific habitats it was evident that A. arabiensis was mainly breeding in rain-fed rice fields along the edge of the alluvial soils. Anopheles melas and A. gambiae s.s. often coexisted but whereas A. melas were found in water with a salinity of up to 72\% sea water (25.2 g NaCl l(-1)), A. gambiae s.s. only occurred in water with up to 30\% sea water (10.5 g NaCl l(-1)). Anopheles melas larvae were found in association with plant communities dominated by sedges and grasses (Eleocharis sp., Paspalum sp., Sporobolus sp.) and sea-purslane Sesuvium portulacastrum (L.) and the presence of cattle hoof prints, whereas A. gambiae s.s. larvae mainly occurred in association with Paspalum sp. and Eleocharis sp.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of the sterile insect technique (SIT) requires mass-production of sterile males of good biological quality. The size of the project area will in most cases determine whether it is more cost effective to produce the sterile flies locally (and invest in a mass-rearing facility) or import the sterile flies from a mass-rearing facility that is located in another country. This study aimed at assessing the effect of long distance transport of sterile male Glossina palpalis gambiensis pupae on adult male fly yield., METHODS: The male pupae were produced at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES), Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, and shipped with a commercial courier service in insulated transport boxes at a temperature of +/-10degreeC to Senegal (+/-36 h of transport). Upon arrival in the insectary in Dakar, the pupae were transferred to an emergence room and the flies monitored for 3-6 days., RESULTS: The results showed that the used system of isothermal boxes that contained phase change material packs (S8) managed to keep the temperature at around 10degreeC which prevented male fly emergence during transport. The emergence rate was significantly higher for pupae from batch 2 (chilled at 4degreeC for one day in the source insectary before transport) than those from batch 1 (chilled at 4degreeC for two days in the source insectary before transport) i.e. an average (+/-sd) of 76.1 +/- 13.2\% and 72.2 +/- 14.3\%, respectively with a small proportion emerging during transport (0.7 +/- 1.7\% and 0.9 +/- 2.9\%, respectively). Among the emerged flies, the percentage with deformed (not fully expanded) wings was significantly higher for flies from batch 1 (12.0 +/- 6.3\%) than from batch 2 (10.7 +/- 7.5\%). The amount of sterile males available for release as a proportion of the total pupae shipped was 65.8 +/- 13.3\% and 61.7 +/- 14.7\% for batch 1 and 2 pupae, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results also showed that the temperature inside the parcel must be controlled around 10degreeC with a maximal deviation of 3degreeC to maximize the male yield.},

	abstract = {Background: During the last decades two dams were constructed along the Senegal River. These intensified the practice of agriculture along the river valley basin. We conducted a study to assess malaria vector diversity, dynamics and malaria transmission in the area. Methods: A cross-sectional entomological study was performed in September 2008 in 20 villages of the middle Senegal River valley to evaluate the variations of Anopheles density according to local environment. A longitudinal study was performed, from October 2008 to January 2010, in 5 selected villages, to study seasonal variations of malaria transmission. Results: Among malaria vectors, 72.34\% of specimens collected were An. arabiensis, 5.28\% An. gambiae of the S molecular form, 3.26\% M form, 12.90\% An. pharoensis, 4.70\% An. ziemanni, 1.48\% An. funestus and 0.04\% An. wellcomei. Anopheles density varied according to village location. It ranged from 0 to 21.4 Anopheles/room/day and was significantly correlated with the distance to the nearest ditch water but not to the river. Seasonal variations of Anopheles density and variety were observed with higher human biting rates during the rainy season (8.28 and 7.55 Anopheles bite/man/night in October 2008 and 2009 respectively). Transmission was low and limited to the rainy season (0.05 and 0.06 infected bite/man/night in October 2008 and 2009 respectively). During the rainy season, the endophagous rate was lower, the anthropophagic rate higher and L1014F kdr frequency higher. Conclusions: Malaria vectors are present at low-moderate density in the middle Senegal River basin with An. arabiensis as the predominant species. Other potential vectors are An. gambiae M and S form and An. funestus. Nonetheless, malaria transmission was extremely low and seasonal.},

	abstract = {In West and Central Africa endemic malaria and epidemic yellow fever are still main causes of morbidity and mortality. From Dakar in Senegal to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo the pattern of malaria transmission shows a huge variability, in term of dynamics (rhythm and intensity) of transmission, as well as in terms of the vector species involved. The Plasmodium annual entomological inoculation rates (EIR) vary from less than one to more than 1000 infectious bites per person and P. falciparum represents more than 90\% of malaria infections. In most settings south of the Sahara, several vector species are sympatrically involved in malaria transmission either simultaneously or replacing each other seasonally (Coluzzi 1984; Fontenille and Simard 2004). These vectors differ greatly in terms of density and vector efficiency. Despite an efficient vaccine, deadly outbreaks of Yellow Fever (YF) virus, which circulates among monkeys and sylvatic vectors, still occur occasionally from Cameroon to Senegal (Mutebi and Barrett 2002). Although Aedes aegypti, the local vector, is abundant, and Dengue 2 virus is present in the forest, human dengue remains very rare and localized in Western Africa. But the situation could worsen with the recent introduction and spreading of Ae. albopictus, a potential dengue vector, in Central Africa. Any vector control strategy, whether based on traditional (insecticides and impregnated/treated nets) or genetic control strategies (sterile-male releases or introduction of transgenic mosquitoes), aiming at significantly reducing malaria burden or yellow fever/dengue occurrence in Africa, will have to account for such entomological heterogeneity added to ecological and socio-economic diversities. This paper provides an update on the bionomics and genetics of the four major African malaria vector systems (the Anopheles gambiae complex and the An. funestus, An. nili and An. moucheti species groups) and of the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus species. It also reviews current vector control measures against malaria and yellow-fever vectors.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1157-5999},
	abstract = {We previously investigated malaria in the southern health district of the city of Dakar, which includes the oldest neighborhoods. In this study, we investigated malaria in the central health district, corresponding to the central area of the conurbation. The study was carried out at 12 sites, from March 1996 to February 1997. The sites were selected such that the entire district was covered and included 2 sites in the shanty town and three in an old village that has been absorbed into the city. We carried out prospective monthly entomological analyses with a view to identifying the vectors and the mode of transmission of malaria. We also carried out clinical and parasitological follow up to determine the incidence of parasitemia and of bouts of malaria. Insects were collected overnight from humans and the insects remaining the next morning in 10 bedrooms in the health district were collected. For clinical and parasitological follow up, families were visited at home once per week and their clinical state was assessed. Blood smears were taken to facilitate the detection of bouts of malaria. Body temperature was measured and we checked for the presence of organisms in the blood systematically during the last weekly visit of each month. For a total of 308 collections at night from human volunteers and 1,395 bedroom collections of residual fauna, we obtained 12,879 Culicidae females, 199 (1.5\%) of which were anopheles mosquitoes, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 98\% of the remaining mosquitoes. As in the southern district, A. arabiensis was the only species of the A. gambiae complex collected. Anopheles mosquitoes accounted for only 0.3 bites per man per night and 0.07 females per room. They were therefore poorly represented in this district and were not detected at all at five sites. They were found in large numbers only during the rainy season, especially in September, when they accounted for 2.25 bites per man per night and 0.3 females per room at 3 sites in an undeveloped zone in which 81.4\% of all the anopheles mosquitoes were collected. The parturition frequency of the biting females was 32.6\% and that of the females collected in houses was 50.0\%. None of the A. arabiensis females dissected (98.5\% of those collected) carried Plasmodium sporozoites. The clinical and parasitological follow up concerned 2,583 individuals, aged from 1 month to 80 years, from 285 families resident in Dakar who volunteered for the study; 41.9\% of these individuals were less than 15 years old and 92.2\% had been living in Dakar for more than 2 years. Thick and thin blood smears taken monthly showed the frequency of the parasite to be 1.0\% and that of gametocytes to be 0.1\%. P. falciparum was the only parasite detected in the subjects. Plasmodium infections were observed in all age groups, with a frequency of 0.4\% (adults over the age of 20 years) to 1.6\% (children under two years of age). Parasitized subjects were detected in every month of the study, with a frequency of 0.4\% (in January) to 1.9\% (in December). The largest number of cases detected in a three-month period (38.8\% of all cases) was that for October to December, the three-month period immediately after the rainy season (July to September). Parasite frequency, which was no higher than 1.2\% at 10 sites, was clearly higher at two sites in the shanty town (3.8 and 6.8\%), mostly inhabited by immigrants from rural areas. At the end of the study year, satisfactory weekly follow up was considered to have been achieved for 1,067 of the participants. The annual incidence of parasitemia in this cohort was 5.1\% and that of malaria was 2.4\%. Incidence did not vary significantly with age and was between 1.8\% and 7.6\% for parasitemia and between 0.8\% and 3.5\% for malaria. However, significant differences in incidence were observed between areas. Incidence was higher at the two sites in the shanty town, with rates of 12.1\% and 36.5\% for parasitemia and 6.1\% and 15.9\% for malaria. We were unable to determine the rate of malaria transmission from the entomological data collected. How ver, based on the number of parasitized subjects, we estimate the rate to be one injected anopheles mosquito bite per man every 20 years for the district as a whole and one infected bite per man every 3, 8 and 10 years respectively for the 3 sites at which the highest parasite frequencies were recorded. As for other West African urban centers, the low prevalence in the center and the south of this city is probably due to urban development and easier access to medical care. It may also be due to the geographical situation of the city, in the north of the sahelian area, with a total annual rainfall of less than 400 mm.},

	abstract = {To complete a parasitological survey, entomological prospections were carried out in the southern sanitary District of Dakar, the most urbanized of the city and which includes the city centre and the oldest administrative districts. The prospections took place between June 1994 and May 1995 in sites 1.5 km apart, and distributed in such a manner that they covered the entire area. On a monthly basis, female Culicidae were collected in each site at night on human volunteers, followed the next day by the collection of early morning residual fauna in 10 bedrooms located in district concessions. For a total of 308 collections at night on human volunteers and from 1,510 rooms for the residual fauna, 22,901 female Culicidae were caught of which 167 anopheles, corresponding to 0.7\%, the remaining 98.5\% being Culex quinquefasciatus. This was the species that thus explained the mosquito-nuisance of which the inhabitants of the southern District complained during the period of survey. The female anopheles collected belonged to 2 species, An. arabiensis for 97.6\% of those caught and An. pharoensis for 2.4\%. An. arabiensis were very slightly represented in the southern District with a density of aggressive females of 0.26 bite/man/night (B/M/N) and a density per room of 0.05 female. The aggressive populations appeared to be relatively important only at the end of the rainy season (September-October) with an average of 0.65 B/M/N in sites located at the periphery of the district with a maximum of 1.33 B/M/N. The highest density of endophilic females registered at the end of the rainy season was 0.1 and its highest value in a given site was 0.36 female/room. The parturity rate of aggressive females was 43.5\% and those collected in houses of 84\% with an anthropophilic index of 0.98. None of the dissected An. arabiensis females (77.3\% of those collected) was a carrier of Plasmodium sporozoites and the circum-sporozoite antigen was not found. A very weak density of An. arabiensis and absence of plasmodial infection among dissected females favoured the absence of malarial transmission in the southern District for the period considered. However malaria transmission could not be absolutely ruled out given the presence of hematozoa carriers, as was revealed by the longitudinal follow-up of a cohort carried out concurrently with the entomological prospections of whom some were residents having declared permanent residence in the city for over two years. This entomological data explain the results of the afore mentioned parasitological survey which, with a registered plasmodic index of 0.3\%, means that the southern District can be considered as non endemic. The area is however exposed to the risk of epidemic malaria following an important proliferation of anopheles, which is always possible after heavy rains and flooding and/or an important immigration of persons coming from regions of high malarial endemicity.},

	abstract = {A necessary condition for Rift Valley fever (RVF) emergence is the presence of Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans and Culex (Culex) poicilipes mosquitoes carrying the arbovirus and responsible for the infection. This paper presents a detailed mapping in the Sahelian region of Senegal of zones potentially occupied by these mosquitoes (ZPOMs) whose population density is directly linked to ecozones in the vicinity of small ponds. The vectors habitats and breeding sites have been characterized through an integrated approach combining remote sensing technology, geographical information systems, geographical positioning systems and field observations for proper geo-referencing. From five SPOT-5 images (approximately 10 m spatial resolution) with appropriate channels, a meridional composite transect of 290 x 60 km was first constructed at the height of the summer monsoon. Subsequent ZPOMs covered major ecozones from north to south with different hydrological environments and different patterns pond distributions. It was found that an overall area of 12,817 ha +/- 10\% (about 0.8\% of the transect) is occupied by ponds with an average ZPOM 17 times larger than this (212,813 ha +/- 10\% or about 14\% of the transect). By comparing the very humid year of 2003 with 2006 which had just below normal rainfall, the ZPOMs inter-annual variability was analyzed in a sandy-clayey ecozone with an important hydrofossil riverbed within the Ferlo region of Senegal. Very probably contributing to an increased abundance of vectors by the end of August 2003, it was shown that the aggregate pond area was already about 22 times larger than in August 2006, corresponding to an approximately five times larger total ZPOM. The results show the importance of pin-pointing small ponds (sizes down to 0.1 ha) and their geographical distribution in order to assess animal exposure to the RVF vectors.},

	abstract = {The recent evolution of a strong preference for human hosts in the globally invasive form of Aedes aegypti promotes the transmission of the Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. Recent evidence suggests that this form of Ae. aegypti may have originated in West Africa about 10,000 years ago, but the geographical distribution, ecological correlates, and genetic determinants of preference for human hosts in ancestral African populations are largely unknown. Although African populations are often thought to be primarily animal-biting or opportunistic, they occupy diverse habitats ranging from forests where they encounter few human hosts to highly urbanized cities where humans are by far the most common potential host. We characterized behavioral and genomic variation in 26 forest, rural, and urban populations from seven countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Behavior varied more or less continuously across the continent, ranging from strong preference for animal odors to strong preference for human odor in our assay. Both climatic variables and human population densities predicted behavior, with preference for humans appearing in relatively densely populated areas with high seasonal variation in precipitation in a band across the southern Sahel region. One population in Northern Senegal showed nearly as great a preference for human hosts as a laboratory strains derived from the globally invasive human specialist form. We also use whole genome sequence data to identify genomic loci and evolutionary processes that contribute to behavioral divergence between populations.},

The tests were carried out using a field cage either set up outdoors in Burkina Faso or inside the laboratory in Austria. The target population strains (MLI and SEN) were a few generations from the wild whereas the laboratory-reared flies (BKF) were adapted to laboratory rearing over many generations. The laboratory-reared BKF strain significantly out-competed the MLI strain in the mating tests, but showed close to equal competitiveness with the SEN strain. At least one-third of possible matings occurred during each observation period. The females from the two target populations readily mated with males from the BKF strain. The selected mating parameters and behaviour in the cage showed that there was mating compatibility between the strains and this absence of obvious mating barriers indicates the potential of using BKF strain males in programmes that have a sterile insect technique (SIT) component targeting the two G. p. gambiensis populations of Mali and Senegal.},

	abstract = {Background: Over two dozen mermithid nematodes have been described parasitizing mosquitoes worldwide, however, only two species were found in Africa. Mermithid nematodes kill their mosquito host upon emergence, which suggests that they could be developed as biological control agents of mosquitoes. Both Romanomermis culicivorax and Romanomermis iyengari have been reared for mass release to control numerous Anopheles species vector populations, and in one instance this may have led to reduced malaria prevalence in a human population. Methods: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected during a malaria study in southeastern Senegal. Two different adult blood fed mosquitoes had a single mermithid nematode emerge from their anus while they were being held post-capture. Primers from the 18 S rDNA were developed to sequence nematode DNA and screen mosquitoes for mermithid DNA. 18 S rDNA from the Senegalese mermithid and other mermithid entries in GenBank were used to create a Maximum Parsimony tree of the Mermithidae family. Results: The mermithid was present in 1.8\% ( 10/551) of the sampled adult Anopheles species in our study area. The mermithid was found in An. gambiae s.s., An. funestus, and An. rufipes from the villages of Ndebou, Boundoucondi, and Damboucoye. Maximum parsimony analysis confirmed that the nematode parasites found in Anopheles were indeed mermithid parasites, and of the mermithid sequences available in GenBank, they are most closely related to Strelkovimermis spiculatus. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of mermithids from adult Anopheles mosquitoes in Senegal. The mermithid appears to infect Anopheles mosquitoes that develop in diverse larval habitats. Although maximum parsimony analysis determined the mermithid was closely related to Strelkovimermis spiculatus, several characteristics of the mermithid were more similar to the Empidomermis genus. Future mermithid isolations will hopefully allow: formal taxonomic identification, laboratory colonization, determination of life history traits and species specificity, and characterize its usefulness as a biological control agent.},

Conflicting results have been obtained in comparing relative efficiency of alternative methods, according to the area, the species present and their density. The aim of this study was to compare the number and characteristics of mosquitoes sampled in two areas of Senegal by three different methods: HLC, light traps adjacent to an occupied bed net (LT/N), pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). Methods: Collections were performed in two villages: Dielmo (Soudan savanna) and Bandafassi (Soudan Guinean savanna), two or three nights per month for a 4-5 months period during the maximal transmission season in 2001-2002. Species were identified and Plasmodium infection determined by ELISA. The specific composition, circumsporozoite protein rate and entomological inoculation rate were calculated. Results: The diversity of mosquito species captured was maximal with LT/N, minimal with PSC. The mean number of anopheles captures each night was significantly different according to the method used and the species. PSC displayed a significantly lower anopheles density. HLC was the most efficient sampling method when Anopheles gambiae was the main vector (in Bandafassi); LT/N when it was Anopheles funestus (in Dielmo). A significant correlation was found between HLC and LT/M but correlation parameters were different according to the species. Circumsporozoite protein rates were not significantly different between methods or species. The entomological inoculation rate varied along with vector density and thus with methods and species. Conclusions: The choice of sampling method influenced entomological data recorded. Therefore, the sampling technique has to be chosen according to the vector studied and the aim of the study. Only HLC must be considered as the reference method, but in some conditions LT/N can be used as an alternative method.},

	abstract = {Correct classification of the insect vector is central to the study of arboviral disease. A simple molecular method for identification of the main vectors of the mosquito-borne viruses, dengue, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever in Senegal, West Africa, was developed. We present a system in which the five mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) responsible for the majority of flaviviral disease transmission in Senegal can be reliably identified using small amounts of DNA coextracted during flaviviral screening procedures, via an easy amplification of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase c subunit I or II (COI or COII, respectively). We observed that despite very similar morphology, the two cryptic disease vector species Aedes furcifer Edwards and Aedes taylori Edwards are highly divergent at the molecular level. This sequence variation was used as a basis for the development of a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism system for the differentiation of the two species. We also present the first investigation of the phylogeny of the culicine mosquitoes based on all COI and COII sequences currently available. There seems to be very low intraspecific variation in both genes, whereas interspecific variation is high. As a consequence, COI and COII are ideal candidates for the molecular identification of disease vectors to species level, whereas deeper divergences remain equivocal by using these genes. This system provides a new technique for the accurate identification of culicine disease vectors in West Africa and provides a basis for the expansion of such methods into the study of a range of diseases.},

Equilibrium and stability theorems are given which show that with a basic reproduction number R0 below unity, then in the absence of reinvasion the disease goes to extinction. However, even a low prevalence rate among reinvading flies can then bring about significant equilibrium prevalence rates among humans. For a set of realistic parameter values we show that even in the case of a virulent parasite that keeps infected individuals in the first stage for as little as 4 or 8 months (durations for which there would be extinction with no infected reinvading flies) there is a prevalence rate in the range 13.0-36.9\%, depending on whether 1 or 2\% of reinvading flies are infected. A rate of convergence of the population dynamics is introduced and is interpreted in terms of a halving time of the infected population. It is argued that the persistence and/or extension of Gambian sleeping sickness foci could be due either to a continuous reinvasion of infected flies or to slow dynamics.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases like Rift Valley Fever and Malaria that cause serious health threat to human and livestock populations are known to correlate with the tremendous increase of associated mosquito vectors following periods of widespread and heavy rainfall. In the Barkedji area, Senegal, rainfall occur only during the July October wet season, and mosquito breeding sites are provided by relatively small temporary ponds, which account for the vast majority of the water surfaces during the rainy season. Given that rain fed ponds play a key role in the epidemiology of the mosquito-borne diseases, we have developed an approach allowing to model the flooding/drying dynamics of rain fed ponds in the Barkedji area by combining the detection of ponds using optical remote sensing techniques, field data on a small set of monitored ponds and modeling of both the pond profile, shapes and the flooding/drying dynamics at the single-pond level for each pond in the entire region. As a result, we have computed on output the daily flooding/drying dynamics for each of the 1345 rain fed ponds detected in Barkedji area as a function of the daily rainfall in input. As dry and fluctuating ponds are less productive in mosquitoes, the ponds are characterizes in terms of flooding-drying fluctuations and of resistance to dryness by computing the total number of time per year a pond dries out and the pond lifetime, respectively. And, clusters of ponds with identical behavior, i.e., clusters of temporary, semi-permanent and permanent ponds, were subsequently identified. As a perspective, we show how this work can be used for modelling mosquito population dynamics and addressing the issues of associated impacts of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the factors impacting their occurrence are poorly investigated and still unknown. In this study, we examine the impact of climate and environmental factors on the likelihood of occurrence of the two main vectors of RVF in West Africa (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) hotspots., METHODS: We used generalized linear mixed models taking into account spatial autocorrelation, in order to overcome the default threshold for areas with high mosquito abundance identified by these models. Getis' Gi*(d) index was used to define local adult mosquito abundance clusters (hotspot)., RESULTS: For Culex poicilipes, a decrease of the minimum temperature promotes the occurrence of hotspots, whereas, for Aedes vexans, the likelihood of hotspot occurrence is negatively correlated with relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures. However, for the two vectors, proximity to ponds would increase the risk of being in an hotspot area., CONCLUSIONS: These results may be useful in the improvement of RVF monitoring and vector control management in the Barkedji area.},

	abstract = {In West Africa, losses due to heartwater disease are not known because the incidence/prevalence has not been well studied or documented. To develop a diagnostic tool for molecular epidemiology, three PCR-based diagnostic assays, a nested pCS20 PCR, a nested map1 PCR and a nested reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay, were evaluated to determine their ability to detect infection in vector ticks, by applying them simultaneously to A. variegatum field ticks to detect Ehrlichia ruminantium, the causative agent of heartwater. The nested pCS20 PCR assay which amplified the pCS20 gene fragment showed the highest detection performance with a detection rate of 16.6\%; the nested map1 PCR, which amplified the gene encoding the major antigenic protein1 (map1 gene) showed a detection rate of 11\% and the RLB, based on the 16S rDNA sequence of anaplasma and ehrlichial species, detected 6.2\%. The RLB, in addition, demonstrated molecular evidence of Ehrlichia ovina, Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma ovis infections in The Gambia. Subsequently, the pCS20 assay was applied to study the prevalence and distribution of E. ruminantium tick infection rates at different sites in five divisions of The Gambia. The rates of infection in the country ranged from 1.6\% to 15.1\% with higher prevalences detected at sites in the westerly divisions (Western, Lower River and North Bank; range 8.3-15.1\%) than in the easterly divisions (Central River and Upper River; range 1.6-7.5\%). This study demonstrated a gradient in the distribution of heartwater disease risk for susceptible livestock in The Gambia which factor must be considered in the overall design of future upgrading programmes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Its determination has been exclusively based on morphological features, geographical distribution and vector competence. Some ambiguities persist in its systematics and may cause misunderstanding about West African human relapsing fevers epidemiology. By amplifying and aligning 16S and 18S rDNA genes in O. sonrai specimens collected from 14 distinct sites in Senegal and Mauritania, we showed the existence of four genetically different subgroups that were morphologically and ecologically identified as belonging to the same species. Within O. sonrai, intraspecific polymorphism was high (pairwise divergence from 0.2\% to 16.4\%). In all cases, these four subgroups formed a monophyletic clade sharing a common ancestor with East African soft ticks that transmit Borrelia duttoni human relapsing fever. From amplification of the flagellin gene of B. crocidurae we verified that all subgroups of O. sonrai were infected by B. crocidurae and may constitute vectors for this pathogen. All flagellin sequences were identical, refuting the hypothesis suggesting parallel evolution between O. sonrai and B. crocidurae. However, differences in infection rates were significant, suggesting different vector competences between subgroups of O. sonrai. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to assess the diversity of the species of Anaplasmataceae in Senegal that infect animals and ticks in three areas: near Keur Momar Sarr (northern region), Dielmo and Diop (Sine Saloum, central region of Senegal), and in Casamance (southern region of Senegal)., METHODS: A total of 204 ticks and 433 blood samples were collected from ruminants, horses, donkeys and dogs. Ticks were identified morphologically and by molecular characterization targeting the 12S rRNA gene. Molecular characterization of species of Anaplasmataceae infecting Senegalese ticks and animals was conducted using the 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA, rpoB and groEL genes., RESULTS: Ticks were identified as Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (84.3\%), Hyalomma rufipes (8.3\%), Hyalomma impeltatum (4.9\%), R. bursa (1.5\%) and R. muhsamae (0.9\%). The overall prevalence of Anaplasmataceae infection in ticks was 0.9\%, whereas 41.1\% of the sampled animals were found infected by one of the species belonging to this family. We identified the pathogen Anaplasma ovis in 55.9\% of sheep, A. marginale and A. centrale in 19.4\% and 8.1\%, respectively, of cattle, as well as a putative new species of Anaplasmataceae. Two Anaplasma species commonly infecting ruminants were identified. Anaplasma cf. platys, closely related to A. platys was identified in 19.8\% of sheep, 27.7\% of goats and 22.6\% of cattle, whereas a putative new species, named here provisionally "Candidatus Anaplasma africae", was identified in 3.7\% of sheep, 10.3\% of goats and 8.1\% of cattle. Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys were identified only from dogs sampled in the Keur Momar Sarr area. Ehrlichia canis was identified in 18.8\% of dogs and two R. e. evertsi ticks removed from the same sheep. Anaplasma platys was identified in 15.6\% of dogs. Neither of the dogs sampled from Casamance region nor the horses and donkeys sampled from Keur Momar Sarr area were found infected by an Anaplasmataceae species., CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a summary of Anaplasmataceae species that infect animals and ticks in three areas from the northern, central and southern regions of Senegal. To our knowledge, our findings demonstrate for the first time the presence of multiple Anaplasmataceae species that infect ticks and domestic animals in Senegal. We recorded two potentially new species commonly infecting ruminants named here provisionally as Anaplasma cf. platys and "Candidatus Anaplasma africae". However, E. canis was the only species identified and amplified from ticks. None of the other Anaplasmataceae species identified in animals were identified in the tick species collected from animals.},

	abstract = {Background The Government of Senegal has embarked several years ago on a project that aims to eradicate Glossina palpalis gambiensis from the Niayes area. The removal of the animal try-panosomosis would allow the development more efficient livestock production systems. The project was implemented using an area-wide integrated pest management strategy including a sterile insect technique (SIT) component. The released sterile male flies originated from a colony from Burkina Faso. Methodology/Principal Findings Monitoring the efficacy of the sterile male releases requires the discrimination between wild and sterile male G.p. gambiensis that are sampled in monitoring traps. Before being released, sterile male flies were marked with a fluorescent dye powder. The marking was however not infallible with some sterile flies only slightly marked or some wild flies contaminated with a few dye particles in the monitoring traps. Trapped flies can also be damaged due to predation by ants, making it difficult to discriminate between wild and sterile males using a fluorescence camera and / or a fluorescence microscope. We developed a molecular technique based on the determination of cytochrome oxidase haplotypes of G. p. gambiensis to discriminate between wild and sterile males. DNA was isolated from the head of flies and a portion of the 5' end of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I was amplified to be finally sequenced. Our results indicated that all the sterile males from the Burkina Faso colony displayed the same haplotype and systematically differed from wild male flies trapped in Senegal and Burkina Faso. This allowed 100\% discrimination between sterile and wild male G. p. gambiensis. Conclusions/Significance This tool might be useful for other tsetse control campaigns with a SIT component in the framework of the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) and, more generally, for other vector or insect pest control programs.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti (Linne, 1762) is a major vector of arboviruses such as Yellow Fever, Dengue and Chikungunya. In Africa, where the species exhibits major variations in morphology, ecology, behavior and vector competence, two subspecies have been described: a light form, named Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) with highly domestic and anthropophilic habits and a cosmotropical distribution; and a dark form, referred to as Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf), which is endemic to Africa and thrives in sylvan environments. In East Africa, both forms were described to occur in sympatry whereas only Aaf was reported from Central/West Africa. However, recent findings suggest Aaa was also common in Senegal. Here, we report on a longitudinal survey of morphological and genetic variability of Ae. aegypti sampled in the rural environment of Niakhar, Senegal. In agreement with recent findings, most of specimens we analyzed were classified as Aaa suggesting typical Aaf was scarce in the studied area. Among Aaa, significant temporal variations in abdominal pale scales pattern were detected. Depending on the season and the nature of larval breeding places, the specimens (particularly females) tend to segregate in two main morphological groups. Microsatellite-based estimates of genetic differentiation did not provide any clear evidence that the two groups were genetically distinct. Overall, these results improve our understanding of the diversity of Ae. aegypti in West Africa, where data are crucially lacking. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses to humans. In Africa, two subspecies, Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) and Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf) have been described. Until very recently, it was considered that the two forms were sympatric in East Africa and that only Aaf was present in Central and West Africa. However, recent data suggests that Aaa was also common in Senegal without any clear evidence of genetic differences with Aaf. This study was carried out in different Ae. aegypti populations from Senegal to better clarify their taxonomic status. The larvae, pupae and eggs were collected between July and September 2018 and reared individually to adult stage. For each population, F1 progeny from eggs laid by a single female F0 were reared as sibling samples. The number of pale scales on the first abdominal tergite (T1) and the basal part of the second tergite (T2) were counted. Individuals with no pale scale on T1 were classified as Aaf while those with at least one pale scale on this tergite were classified as Aaa. The morphological variations within families of Aaf were studied across 4 generations. In total, 2400 individuals constituting 240 families were identified, of which 42.5\% were heterogeneous (families with both forms). Multivariate statistical analysis of variance including T1 and T2 data together showed that populations were significantly different from each other. Statistical analysis of T1 alone showed a similarity between populations from the southeast while variations were observed within northwest population. The analysis of family composition across generations showed the presence of Aaa and Aaf forms in each generation. The classification of Ae. aegypti into two subspecies is invalid in Senegal. Populations exhibit morphological polymorphism at the intra-family level that could have biological and epidemiological impacts.},

Anopheles pharoensis, Culex ethiopicus and C. poicilipes were most common around the middle of the rice-growing cycle 6-13 weeks after the start of full irrigation and showed more extended peaks of abundance. Anopheles ziemanni alone reached maximum numbers as the rice crop neared maturity.

A total of 92 787 mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), belonging to 10 genera and 41 species, were captured in light traps. In Senegal, Culex poicilipes (41\%) and Mansonia uniformis (39\%) were the most abundant species caught, whereas Aedes vexans (77\%) and Cx. poicilipes (15\%) predominated in Mauritania. RVF virus was isolated from 63 pools of Cx. poicilipes: 36 from Senegal in 1998 and 27 from Mauritania in 1999. These results are the first field evidence of Cx. poicilipes naturally infected with RVFV, and the first isolations of this virus from mosquitoes in Mauritania - the main West African epidemic and epizootic area. Additional arbovirus isolates comprised 25 strains of Bagaza (BAG) from Aedes fowleri, Culex neavei and Cx. poicilipes; 67 Sanar (ArD 66707) from Cx. poicilipes; 51 Wesselsbron (WSL) from Ae. vexans and 30 strains of West Nile (WN) from Ma. uniformis, showing differential specific virus-vector associations in the circulation activity of these five arboviruses.},

Mention of their presence/absence was tackled in the literature and by specialized websites for eight African countries: Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad. In total, 216 species have been recorded belonging to 13 genera: Anopheles (48 species), Aedeomyia (2), Aedes (62), Coquillettidia (6), Culex (54), Culiseta (1), Eretmapodites (7), Ficalbia (3), Lutzia (1), Mansonia (2), Mimomyia (7), Toxorhynchites (4) and Uranotaenia (19). The presence of these species in the study area is certain except for three species whose presence is doubtful. This specific richness represents 6\% of the world's richness. The countries with the highest specific richness are Burkina Faso (162 species), Senegal (143) and Mali (110); the country with the lowest richness is Cape Verde (11). This richness is lower in the north in hyper-arid climate and higher in the south in sub-humid climate. Chad is the least well inventoried country. All species are considered native, with the exception of Ae. (Stegomyia ) albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito) introduced in 2016 into Mali and possibly Ae. (Ochlerotatus ) caspius into Mauritania and Ae. (Stg. ) aegypti introduced into Nouakchott, Mauritania.

	abstract = {Tsetse eradication continues to be a top priority for African governments including that of Senegal, which embarked on a project to eliminate Glossina palpalis gambiensis from the Niayes area, following an area-wide integrated pest management approach with an SIT component. A successful SIT programme requires competitive sterile males of high biological quality. This may be hampered by handling processes including irradiation and the release mechanisms, necessitating continued improvement of these processes, to maintain the quality of flies. A new prototype of an automated chilled adult release system (Bruno Spreader Innovation, (BSI TM)) for tsetse flies was tested for its accuracy (in counting) and release rate consistency. Also, its impact on the quality of the released sterile males was evaluated on performance indicators, including flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating duration, insemination rate of mated females and survival of male flies. The BSITM release system accurately counted and homogenously released flies at the lowest motor speed set (0.6 rpm), at a consistent rate of 60+/-9.58 males/min. Also, the release process, chilling (6 +/- 1degreeC) and passing of flies through the machine) had no significant negative impact on the male flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating durations and the insemination rates. Only the survival of flies was negatively affected whether under feeding or starvation. The positive results of this study show that the BSI TM release system is promising for use in future tsetse SIT programmes. However, the negative impact of the release process on survival of flies needs to be addressed in future studies and results of this study confirmed under operational field conditions in West Africa.},

Previous studies in this area showed that Sergentomyia schwetzi could be the potential vector of Le. infantum. To precisely describe the biology and population structure of this potential vector, we identified eight novel microsatellite loci to characterize Se. schwetzi populations. We tested these loci in Se. schwetzi populations from five locations at Mont Rolland (Thies, Senegal). All the loci were polymorphic, with a mean of 17.25 alleles (observed heterozygosity: 0.455). We did not detect any evidence of scoring errors due to stuttering and large allele dropout. Moreover, several of these loci were also amplified in six other sand fly species (Sergentomyia magna, Sergentomyia dubia, Sergentomyia minuta, Phlebotomus duboscqi, Phlebotomus perniciosus, and Phlebotomus ariasi). These preliminary results demonstrate the utility of these microsatellite markers for Se. schwetzi (and for the other sand fly species) population genetic studies. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Here we characterize Niakha virus (NIAV), a previously uncharacterized rhabdovirus isolated from phebotomine sandflies in Senegal. Analysis of the 11,124 nt genome sequence indicates that it encodes the five common rhabdovirus proteins with alternative ORFs in the M, G and L genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the L protein indicate that NIAV's closest relative is Oak Vale rhabdovirus, although still so phylogenetically distinct that it may be not classified as a member of the eight recognized Rhabdoviridae genera.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Baited traps are potential tools for removal or surveillance of disease vectors. To optimize the use of counter-flow traps baited with human odor (nylon socks that had been worn for a single day) to capture wild mosquitoes in the Gambia, investigations were conducted at a field experimental site., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Experiments employing Latin square design were conducted with a set of six huts to investigate the effects of the following on overnight mosquito trap catches: (1) placement of traps indoors or immediately outdoors, CO(2) supply, and presence of a human subject in the hut; (2) trap height for collecting mosquitoes immediately outdoors; (3) height and distance from hut; (4) interaction between multiple traps around a single hut and entry of mosquitoes into huts. A total of 106,600 adult mosquitoes (9.1\% Anopheles gambiae s.l., 4.0\% other Anopheles species) were collected over 42 nights. The high numbers of An. gambiae s.l. and other mosquitoes collected by odor-baited traps required CO(2) but were largely independent of the presence of a person sleeping in the hut or of trap placement indoors or outdoors. For outdoor collection that is considered less intrusive, traps opening 15 cm above the floor of the hut veranda were more highly effective than traps at other heights or further from the hut. There was no significant evidence of saturation or competition by the traps, with multiple traps around a hut each collecting almost as many mosquitoes as single traps and no effect on the numbers of mosquitoes entering the huts., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The outdoor trapping protocol is convenient to compare attractiveness of different odors or synthetic chemicals to malaria vectors and other wild mosquitoes. The finding that such traps are reliably attractive in the presence or absence of a human volunteer encourages their potential development as standardised surveillance tools.},

The Insectarium de Bobo-Dioulasso (IBD) was created and equipped in the frame of Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) with the main goal to provide sterile males for the different eradication programs in West Africa which is already the case with the ongoing eradication program in Senegal. The aim of this study was to identify the best feeding regime in mass-rearing colonies of Glossina palpalis gambiensis to optimize the yield of sterile males. We investigated the mortality and fecundity for various feeding regimes and day alternation (3x: Monday-Wednesday-Friday, 4x: Monday-Wednesday-Friday-Saturday, 4x: Monday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday and 6x: all days except Sunday) on adult tsetse flies in routine rearing over 60 days after emergence. The day alternation in the 4 blood meals per week (feeding regimes 2 and 3) had no effect on tsetse fly mortality and fecundity. The best feeding regime was the regime of 4 blood meals per week which resulted in higher significant fecundity (PPIF = 2.5; P = 0.003) combined with lower mortality of females (P = 0.0003) than the 3 blood meals per week (PPIF = 2.0) and in similar fecundity (PPIF = 2.6; P = 0.70) and mortality (P = 0.51) than the 6 blood meals per week. This feeding regime was extended to the whole colonies, resulting in an improved yield of sterile males for the ongoing eradication program in Senegal and would be more cost-effective for the implementation of the next-coming sterile insect technique (SIT) programs in West Africa.Copyright © 2021 Pagabeleguem et al.

	abstract = {The soft ticks, Ornithodoros sonrai, are known as vectors of the tick-borne relapsing fever caused by Borrelia spp. and have also been reported to carry other micro-organisms. The objective of this study was to collect and to identify O. sonrai ticks and to investigate the micro-organisms associated with them. In 2019, an investigation of burrows within human dwellings was conducted in 17 villages in the Niakhar area and in 15 villages in the Sine-Saloum area in the Fatick region of Senegal. Ticks collected from the burrows were identified morphologically and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Micro-organism screening was performed by bacteria-specific qPCR and some identifications were made by standard PCR and gene sequencing. O. sonrai ticks were found in 100\% (17/17) of the villages surveyed in the Niakhar area and in 66\% (10/15) of the villages in the Sine-Saloum area. A total of 1275 soft tick specimens were collected from small mammal burrows. The ticks collected were morphologically identified as O. sonrai. About 20\% (259/1275) of the specimens were also submitted to MALDI-TOF MS for identification. Among the resulting MS profiles, 87\% (139/159) and 95\% (95/100) were considered good quality specimens, preserved in alcohol and silica gel, respectively. All spectra of good quality were tested against our MALDI-TOF MS arthropod spectra database and identified as O. sonrai species, corroborating the morphological classification. The carriage of four micro-organisms was detected in the ticks with a high prevalence of Bartonella spp., Anaplasmataceae, and Borrelia spp. of 35, 28, and 26\%, respectively, and low carriage of Coxiella burnetii (2\%). This study highlights the level of tick infestation in domestic burrows, the inventory of pathogens associated with the O. sonrai tick, and the concern about the potential risk of tick involvement in the transmission of these pathogens in Senegal.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

Borrelia crocidurae was found in one O. sonrai tick and 18 Mus musculus domesticus samples, with prevalences of 0.39 percent and 12 percent, respectively, as well as Ehrlichia sp. in one Mus musculus domesticus. Further, we were able to detect the presence of a potentially infectious novel species belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family for the first time in O. sonrai ticks.

Despite extreme seasonal fluctuation in abundance with dry season minima in which mosquitoes virtually disappeared, allele frequencies remained stable over time in the village of Barkedji from August 1994 to December 1997 (including four rainy seasons and three dry seasons). The effective population size (Ne) was estimated to be 601 with 95\% CI (281, 1592), providing strong evidence against annual bottlenecks. Differences in measures of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium between the dry and the rainy seasons were not detected.

	abstract = {Background: Anopheles funestus is one of the major malaria vectors in tropical Africa. Because of several cycles of drought events that occurred during the 1970s, this species had disappeared from many parts of sahelian Africa, including the Senegal River basin. However, this zone has been re-colonized during the last decade by An. funestus, following the implementation of two dams on the Senegal River. Previous studies in that area revealed heterogeneity at the biological and chromosomal level among these recent populations. Methods: Here, we studied the genetic structure of the newly established mosquito populations using eleven microsatellite markers in four villages of the Senegal River basin and compared it to another An. funestus population located in the sudanian domain. Results: Our results presume Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in each An. funestus population, suggesting a situation of panmixia. Moreover, no signal from bottleneck or population expansion was detected across populations. The tests of genetic differentiation between sites revealed a slight but significant division into three distinct genetic entities. Genetic distance between populations from the Senegal River basin and sudanian domain was correlated to geographical distance. In contrast, sub-division into the Senegal River basin was not correlated to geographic distance, rather to local adaptation. Conclusions: The high genetic diversity among populations from Senegal River basin coupled with no evidence of bottleneck and with a gene flow with southern population suggests that the re-colonization was likely carried out by a massive and repeated stepping-stone dispersion starting from the neighboring areas where An. funestus endured.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Government of Senegal has initiated the "Projet de lutte contre les glossines dans les Niayes" to remove the trypanosomosis problem from this area in a sustainable way. Due to past failures to sustainably eradicate Glossina palpalis gambiensis from the Niayes area, controversies remain as to the best strategy implement, i.e. "eradication" versus "suppression." To inform this debate, we used population genetics to measure genetic differentiation between G. palpalis gambiensis from the Niayes and those from the southern tsetse belt (Missira)., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three different markers (microsatellite DNA, mitochondrial CO1 DNA, and geometric morphometrics of the wings) were used on 153 individuals and revealed that the G. p. gambiensis populations of the Niayes were genetically isolated from the nearest proximate known population of Missira. The genetic differentiation measured between these two areas (theta = 0.12 using microsatellites) was equivalent to a between-taxa differentiation. We also demonstrated that within the Niayes, the population from Dakar - Hann was isolated from the others and had probably experienced a bottleneck., CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The information presented in this paper leads to the recommendation that an eradication strategy for the Niayes populations is advisable. This kind of study may be repeated in other habitats and for other tsetse species to (i) help decision on appropriate tsetse control strategies and (ii) find other possible discontinuities in tsetse distribution.},

Twenty six haplotype combinations were found, of which 17 were shared among two or more populations. Nine haplotypes were found in The Gambia and 23 haplotypes in Ethiopia. There were 12 unique haplotypes. Only six haplotypes were shared between the two countries. Populations in The Gambia (h(e) = 0.26 +/- 0.04) showed less than a third of the diversity of populations in Ethiopia (h(e) = 0.84 +/- 0.03). This suggests recovery from an earlier reduction in population. In a nested analysis of molecular variance of haplotype frequencies, 65\% of the variance was due to differences within populations, 34\% to differences between populations grouped by country, and only 1\% was due to differences among populations within countries. In terms of gene flow, the fixation index F-ST = 0.35, which leads to an estimate by Wright's island model of less than one reproducing migrant per generation exchanged between the eastern and western submorsitans populations.

	issn = {1741-7007},
	doi = {10.1186/s12915-017-0351-0},
	abstract = {Background: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. This major disease vector is thought to have arisen when the African subspecies Ae. aegypti formosus evolved from being zoophilic and living in forest habitats into a form that specialises on humans and resides near human population centres. The resulting domestic subspecies, Ae. aegypti aegypti, is found throughout the tropics and largely blood-feeds on humans. Results: To understand this transition, we have sequenced the exomes of mosquitoes collected from five populations from around the world. We found that Ae. aegypti specimens from an urban population in Senegal in West Africa were more closely related to populations in Mexico and Sri Lanka than they were to a nearby forest population. We estimate that the populations in Senegal and Mexico split just a few hundred years ago, and we found no evidence of Ae. aegypti aegypti mosquitoes migrating back to Africa from elsewhere in the tropics. The out-of-Africa migration was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in effective population size, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity and rare genetic variants. Conclusions: We conclude that a domestic population of Ae. aegypti in Senegal and domestic populations on other continents are more closely related to each other than to other African populations. This suggests that an ancestral population of Ae. aegypti evolved to become a human specialist in Africa, giving rise to the subspecies Ae. aegypti aegypti. The descendants of this population are still found in West Africa today, and the rest of the world was colonised when mosquitoes from this population migrated out of Africa. This is the first report of an African population of Ae. aegypti aegypti mosquitoes that is closely related to Asian and American populations. As the two subspecies differ in their ability to vector disease, their existence side by side in West Africa may have important implications for disease transmission.},

In Burkina Faso, this was interpreted as evidence for incipient speciation, and two chromosomal forms were described, namely 'Folonzo' and 'Kiribina'. Assignation of field collected specimens to one chromosomal form depends upon application of an algorithm based on chromosomal inversions. We assessed relevance and applicability of this algorithm on An. funestus populations from Senegal, where both forms occur. Furthermore, we estimated the level of genetic differentiation between populations using microsatellite loci spread over the whole genome. Significant genetic differentiation was revealed between geographical populations of An. funestus, and the pattern observed suggested isolation by distance. Chromosomal heterogeneity was not detected by microsatellite markers. Thus, although incipient speciation could not be ruled out by our data, our results suggest that differential environmental selection pressure acting on inversions should be considered a major factor in shaping their distribution in wild An. funestus populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In tropical Africa, trypanosomiasis is present in endemic areas with many other diseases including malaria. Because malaria vectors become more anthropo-zoophilic under the current insecticide pressure, they may be exposed to trypanosome parasites. By collecting mosquitoes in six study sites with distinct malaria infection prevalence and blood sample from cattle, we tried to assess the influence of malaria-trypanosomiasis co-endemicity on the vectorial capacity of Anopheles., RESULTS: Overall, all animal infections were due to Trypanosoma vivax (infection rates from 2.6 to 10.5\%) in villages where the lowest Plasmodium prevalence were observed at the beginning of the study. An. gambiae s.l. displayed trophic preferences for human-animal hosts. Over 84 mosquitoes, only one was infected by Plasmodium falciparum (infection rate: 4.5\%) in a site that displayed the highest prevalence at the beginning of the study. Thus, Anopheles could be exposed to Trypanosoma when they feed on infected animals. No Plasmodium infection was observed in the Trypanosoma-infected animals sites. This can be due to an interaction between both parasites as observed in mice and highlights the need of further studies considering Trypanosoma/Plasmodium mixed infections to better characterize the role of these infections in the dynamic of malaria transmission and the mechanisms involved.},

	abstract = {Dengue fever (DEN) is the most common arboviral disease in the world and dengue virus (DENV) causes 390 million annual infections around the world, of which 240 million are inapparent and 96 million are symptomatic. During the past decade a changing epidemiological pattern has been observed in Africa, with DEN outbreaks reported in all regions. In Senegal, all DENV serotypes have been reported. These important changes in the epidemiological profile of DEN are occurring in a context where there is no qualified vaccine against DEN. Further there is significant gap of knowledge on the vector bionomics and transmission dynamics in the African region to effectively prevent and control epidemics. Except for DENV-2, few studies have been performed with serotypes 1, 3, and 4, so this study was undertaken to fill out this gap. We assessed the vector competence of Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer, Ae. (Diceromyia) taylori, Ae. (Stegomyia) luteocephalus, sylvatic and urban Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti populations from Senegal for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 using experimental oral infection. Whole bodies and wings/legs were tested for DENV presence by cell culture assays and saliva samples were tested by real time RT-PCR to estimate infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Our results revealed a low capacity of sylvatic and urban Aedes mosquitoes from Senegal to transmit DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 and an impact of infection on their mortality. The highest potential transmission rate was 20\% despite the high susceptibility and disseminated infection rates up to 93.7\% for the 3 Ae. aegypti populations tested, and 84.6\% for the sylvatic vectors Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV; genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is an emerging virus of medical importance maintained in a zoonotic cycle between arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes and nonhuman primates in African and Asian forests. Serological evidence and virus isolations have demonstrated widespread distribution of the virus in Senegal. Several mosquito species have been found naturally infected by ZIKV but little is known about their vector competence., METHODS: We assessed the vector competence of Ae. aegypti from Kedougou and Dakar, Ae. unilineatus, Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus from Kedougou in Senegal for 6 ZIKV strains using experimental oral infection. Fully engorged female mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 27 +/- 1 degreeC and 80 +/- 5\% Relative humidity. At day 5, 10 and 15 days post infection (dpi), individual mosquito saliva, legs/wings and bodies were tested for the presence of ZIKV genome using real time RT-PCR to estimate the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates., RESULTS: All the species tested were infected by all viral strains but only Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus were potentially capable of transmitting ZIKV after 15 dpi with 20 and 50\% of mosquitoes, respectively, delivering epidemic (HD 78788) and prototype (MR 766) ZIKV strains in saliva., CONCLUSION: All the species tested here were susceptible to oral infection of ZIKV but only a low proportion of Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus had the viral genome in their saliva and thus the potential to transmit the virus. Further investigations are needed on the vector competence of other species associated with ZIKV for better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of this virus in Senegal.},

	abstract = {Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) strains that circulate in sylvatic habitats of Senegal and other parts of west Africa are believed to represent ancestral forms that evolved into endemic/epidemic strains that now circulate widely in urban areas of the tropics. Previous studies suggested that the evolution of the endemic/epidemic strains was mediated by adaptation to the peridomestic mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We conducted experimental infections using sylvatic and peridomestic Senegalese mosquitoes, and both sylvatic and urban DENV-2 strains to determine if endemic DENV-2 adaptation was vector species specific, and to assess ancestral vector susceptibility. Aedes furcifer and Ae. luteocephalus, probable sylvatic vectors, were highly susceptible to both sylvatic and urban DENV-2 strains. In contrast, sylvatic Ae. vittatus and both sylvatic and peridomestic populations of Ae. aegypti were relative refractory to all DENV-2 strains tested. These results indicate that adaptation of DENV-2 to urban vectors did not result in a loss of infectivity for some African sylvatic vectors. Implications for dengue emergence in west Africa are discussed.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {1252-607X},
	abstract = {In 2005, the Government of Senegal initiated a tsetse eradication campaign in the Niayes and La Petite Cote aiming at the removal of African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT), which is one of the main constraints to the development of more effective cattle production systems. The target area has particular meteorological and ecological characteristics that provide great potential for animal production, but it is unfortunately still infested by the riverine tsetse species Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae). The tsetse project in Senegal has adopted an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach that targets the entire tsetse population within a delimited area. During the first phase of the programme, a feasibility study was conducted that included the collection of entomological, veterinary, population genetics, environmental and socioeconomic baseline data. This paper presents the parasitological and serological prevalence data of AAT in cattle residing inside and outside the tsetse-infested areas of the target zone prior to the control effort. At the herd level, a mean parasitological prevalence of 2.4\% was observed, whereas a serological prevalence of 28.7\%, 4.4\%, and 0.3\% was obtained for Trypanosoma vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei brucei, respectively. The observed infection risk was 3 times higher for T. congolense and T. vivax in the tsetse-infested than in the assumed tsetse-free areas. Moreover, AAT prevalence decreased significantly with distance from the nearest tsetse captured which indicated that cyclical transmission of the parasites by tsetse was predominant over mechanical transmission by numerous other biting flies present. The importance of these results for the development of a control strategy for the planned AW-IPM campaign is discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Tsetse flies are vectors of African trypanosomes, protozoan parasites that cause sleeping sickness (or human African trypanosomosis) in humans and nagana (or animal African trypanosomosis) in livestock. In addition to trypanosomes, four symbiotic bacteria Wigglesworthia glossinidia, Sodalis glossinidius, Wolbachia, Spiroplasma and one pathogen, the salivary gland hypertrophy virus (SGHV), have been reported in different tsetse species. We evaluated the prevalence and coinfection dynamics between Wolbachia, trypanosomes, and SGHV in four tsetse species (Glossina palpalis gambiensis, G. tachinoides, G. morsitans submorsitans, and G. medicorum) that were collected between 2008 and 2015 from 46 geographical locations in West Africa, i.e. Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal. Results: The results indicated an overall low prevalence of SGHV and Wolbachia and a high prevalence of trypanosomes in the sampled wild tsetse populations. The prevalence of all three infections varied among tsetse species and sample origin. The highest trypanosome prevalence was found in Glossina tachinoides (61.1\%) from Ghana and in Glossina palpalis gambiensis (43.7\%) from Senegal. The trypanosome prevalence in the four species from Burkina Faso was lower, i.e. 39.6\% in Glossina medicorum, 18.08\%; in Glossina morsitans submorsitans, 16.8\%; in Glossina tachinoides and 10.5\% in Glossina palpalis gambiensis. The trypanosome prevalence in Glossina palpalis gambiensis was lowest in Mali (6.9\%) and Guinea (2.2\%). The prevalence of SGHV and Wolbachia was very low irrespective of location or tsetse species with an average of 1.7\% for SGHV and 1.0\% for Wolbachia. In some cases, mixed infections with different trypanosome species were detected. The highest prevalence of coinfection was Trypanosoma vivax and other Trypanosoma species (9.5\%) followed by coinfection of T. congolense with other trypanosomes (7.5\%). The prevalence of coinfection of T. vivax and T. congolense was (1.0\%) and no mixed infection of trypanosomes, SGHV and Wolbachia was detected. Conclusion: The results indicated a high rate of trypanosome infection in tsetse wild populations in West African countries but lower infection rate of both Wolbachia and SGHV. Double or triple mixed trypanosome infections were found. In addition, mixed trypanosome and SGHV infections existed however no mixed infections of trypanosome and/or SGHV with Wolbachia were found.},

	abstract = {The importance of rainfall for the development of Aedes vexans arabiensis populations, one of the potential vectors of Rift Valley Fever in West Africa, was demonstrated in a two-year follow-up study conducted in the Ferlo region of Senegal. In 2003, the rainy season began with heavy rains and, as a result, temporary ponds, the breeding places for mosquitoes, were flooded at their maximum level immediately. In such conditions, Aedes vexans arabiensis populations are abundant at the very beginning of the season, when the majority of eggs in quiescence are flooded. Females, hatching from eggs laid the year before, quickly lay eggs on the pond's wet soil, which will undergo dormancy as the water level goes down. Rainless periods longer than seven days, the time needed for embryogenesis, followed by significant rainfall, will result in the hatching of very large numbers of new eggs. Thus, several generations of adults may exist during the same rainy season. Because of potential vertical transmission of Rift Valley Fever virus in Aedes species, viral transmission and disease risk can appear as early as the beginning of the rainy season and if late rains occur, at the end of the season. This dynamic maximizes the virus' chance to persist from one year to another, thus facilitating endemisation of Rift Valley Fever in areas where Aedes vexans arabiensis exists.},

As a generalization of the Davidson formula, we have developed an approach for dealing with the dynamics of structured population of mosquitoes, and derived various formulas allowing assessment of demographic parameters like durations of gonotrophic cycles and (apparent) daily survivals. The method was subsequently applied to field data of floodwater mosquitoes Aedes vexans arabiensis, potential vectors of Rift Valley fever in West Africa, collected during the 2003 rainy season in Barkedji, Senegal. We found that mosquitoes emerged about 3 to 4 days following an efficient rainfall, and mosquito emergences, described by a bell shaped function, lasted for about 2 days. The mean duration of the gonotrophic cycle was 3 days and the apparent daily survival about 0.87. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Anopheles gambiae species complex includes at least seven morphologically indistinguishable species, one of which, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, is the primary mosquito vector responsible for the transmission of malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. Sympatric ecological diversification of An. gambiae s.s. is in progress within this complex, leading to the emergence of at least two incipient species (the M and S molecular forms now recognized as good species and named An. coluzzii and An. gambiae respectively) that show heterogeneous levels of divergence in most parts of Africa. However, this process seems to have broken down in coastal areas of West Africa at the extreme edge of the distribution. We undertook a longitudinal study to describe An. gambiae s.s. populations collected from two inland transects with different ecological characteristics in south-eastern Senegal. Analysis of samples collected from 20 sites across these two transects showed the M and S molecular forms coexisted at almost all sampled sites. Overall, similar hybridization rates (2.16\% and 1.86\%) were recorded in the two transects; sites with relatively high frequencies of M/S hybrids (up to 7\%) were clustered toward the north-western part of both transects, often near urban settings. Estimated inbreeding indices for this putative speciation event varied spatially (range: 0.52-1), with hybridization rates being generally lower than expected under panmictic conditions. Such observations suggest substantial reproductive isolation between the M and S molecular forms, and further support the ongoing process of speciation in these inland areas. According to a recent reclassification of the An. gambiae complex, the M and S molecular forms from this zone correspond to An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, respectively. There is considerable evidence that these molecular forms differ in their behavioural and ecological characteristics. Detailed study of these characteristics will allow the development and implementation of better insect control strategies for combating malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Only the sylvatic and zoophilic population of Aedes aegypti was formerly identified in southeastern Senegal. A newly established anthropophilic population was detected in the urban area of the Kedougou city. Because of its new behavior, this species could play a primary role in the transmission of dengue and other arboviruses in this area. Because these arboviruses have no vaccine and specific treatments, vector control remains the only effective way to control their outbreaks. Effective vector control strategies require to understand some aspects of the bioecology of the vector, specially resting behavior. The aims of this study were to investigate the sites and resting behavior of Ae. aegypti in southeastern Senegal., METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected in several potential resting places (rooms, tires, bricks and scrap metal) by two technicians using a CDC back-pack aspirator in the Kedougou bus station and other sites within the city and the nearby rural area. Collected mosquitoes were identified and classified., RESULTS: A total of 1291 mosquitoes belonging to 6 genera and 20 species were collected. Aedes aegypti was the dominant species in all the resting places investigated. This species was found resting equally in rooms, bricks, tires and scrap metal. The average number of Ae. aegypti collected in resting places was higher in the bus station (center of the city) compared to the other areas. The rates of unfed and fed females varied significantly in the different resting places while the proportions of gravid females which varied between 7.8\% in tires and 1.8\% in rooms were comparable., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Ae. aegypti could be found resting indoors and in several sites, including in used tires outdoors. These data will be helpful in setting better arboviruses surveillance and vector control strategies.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector of most arboviruses in tropical and subtropical urban areas. In West Africa, particularly in Senegal, domestic and wild populations have been described. Both Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) and Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf) were found in progenies of Ae. aegypti families from several localities of Senegal. However, nothing is known about their resting and trophic behavior, which are key data for vector control. To fill this gap, blood-fed mosquitoes were collected monthly indoors and outdoors with BackPack aspirators and BG-Sentinel 2 traps between July and November 2019 from four urban sites. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to analyze blood-fed Aaa and Aaf specimens. Both forms were found resting in all investigated places with the highest proportions found in scrap metals (51.7\% for Aaa and 44.1\% for Aaf) and used tires (19.2\% for Aaa and 26.1\% for Aaf). Blood-fed Aaf females showed lower occupation of the indoors environment compared to Aaa. Overall, the percentages of single bloodmeals from human were 80.5\% (916/1138) for Aaa and 71.1\% (263/370) for Aaf. A low frequency of other domestic hosts, including bovine, ovine, and cat were detected for both forms. This study provides the first data on resting and trophic behavior of Aaa and Aaf in Senegal. Both forms showed differences in their resting behavior but fed primarily on human and highlight the risk of arboviruses transmission in urban areas. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Recent works identified a novel healthcare problem in Africa: acute Rickettsia felis-induced fever that mimics malaria. The epidemiology of these diseases remains to be characterized. Indeed, the natural reservoirs of R. felis are not known. Since the first clinical descriptions of R. felis-associated fever, the cat and dog fleas Ctenocephalides felis and C. canis were implicated as the most probable vectors in many countries, but not in Senegal. Methods \& Materials: Arthropods (ticks, mites, fleas, tsetse flies, biting midges, mosquitoes, bed bugs) and environmental samples (dust and water samples) were collected in the villages of Dielmo and Ndiop where R. felis-associated acute fevers contribute up to 8\% of all acute fevers with the incidence of 6.7 per 100 person-years. DNA extracted from all samples was tested by Rickettsia genus-specific qPCR and by two different R. felis-specific qPCR. Positive environmental samples were subjected to PCR with the universal eukaryotic cytochrome oxydase I-based primers followed by cloning of the amplicons withpGemvectors. Isolation was performed in XTC cell line using the shell-vial technique. Characterization of the isolated strains was done by sequencing of gltA and 16S rRNA genes. Result(s): Arthropods (ticks, mites, fleas, tsetse flies, biting midges, mosquitoes, bed bugs) and environmental samples (dust and water samples) were collected in the villages of Dielmo and Ndiop where R. felis-associated acute fevers contribute up to 8\% of all acute fevers with the incidence of 6.7 per 100 person-years. DNA extracted from all samples was tested by Rickettsia genusspecific qPCR and by two different R. felis-specific qPCR. Positive environmental samples were subjected to PCR with the universal eukaryotic cytochrome oxydase I (COI)-based primers followed by cloning of the amplicons with pGem vectors. Isolation was performed in XTC cell line using the shell-vial technique. Characterization of the isolated strains was done by sequencing of gltA and 16S rRNA genes. Conclusion(s): This is the first evidence of the presence of R. felis in arthropods in the endemic focus or R. felis infection in Senegal. The roles of Siteroptidae mites in the hosting and transmission of the R. felis is to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {During the rainy season, from rainfall events and ponds dynamic in the Barkedji area (Senegal), detailed zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes (ZPOM), and exposure to RVF virus transmission are produced. To that purpose, remotely sampled ponds (from high resolution SPOT-5 images) and rainfall events (from TRMM project) data combined with in-situ measurements (entomology, limnimetry, hydrology, virology) and hosts location (parked ruminants, from QuickBird satellite), are used. The 'Aedes vexans productive rainfall events' are associated with vectors embryogenesis (i.e., 6 days without rain are necessary to trigger hatching). The dynamical spatio-temporal distribution of the Aedes vexans density is presented. Combined with aggressiveness temporal profiles, detailed mapping of ZPOM are obtained on a operational basis. Risks zones (i.e., hazards + vulnerability) and percentage of parked animals under threats, can thus be derived. This methodology is meant to contribute to the implementation of a new operational Early Warning Systems for RVF, or RVFEWS, and is to be applied elsewhere for other vector-borne diseases.},

	doi = {https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-1-41},
	abstract = {Background. Screening doors, windows and eaves of houses should reduce house entry by eusynanthropic insects, including the common African house mosquito Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and other culicines. In the pre-intervention year of a randomized controlled trial investigating the protective effects of house screening against mosquito house entry, a multi-factorial risk factor analysis study was used to identify factors influencing house entry by culicines of nuisance biting and medical importance. These factors were house location, architecture, human occupancy and their mosquito control activities, and the number and type of domestic animals within the compound. Results. 40,407 culicines were caught; the dominant species were Culex thalassius, Cx. pipiens s.l., Mansonia africanus, M. uniformis and Aedes aegypti. There were four times more Cx. pipiens s.l. in Farafenni town (geometric mean/trap/night = 8.1, 95\% confidence intervals, CIs = 7.2-9.1) than in surrounding villages (2.1, 1.9-2.3), but over five times more other culicines in the villages (25.1, 22.1-28.7) than in town (4.6, 4.2-5.2). The presence of Cx. pipiens s.l. was reduced in both settings if the house had closed eaves (odds ratios, OR town = 0.62, 95\% CIs = 0.49-0.77; OR village = 0.49, 0.33-0.73), but increased per additional person in the trapping room (OR town = 1.16, 1.09-1.24; OR village = 1.10, 1.02-1.18). In the town only, Cx. pipiens s.l. numbers were reduced if houses had a thatched roof (OR = 0.70, 0.51-0.96), for each additional cow tethered near the house (OR = 0.73, 0.65-0.82) and with increasing distance from a pit latrine (OR = 0.97, 0.95-0.99). In the villages a reduction in Cx. pipiens s.l. numbers correlated with increased horses in the compound (OR = 0.90, 0.82-0.99). The presence of all other culicines was reduced in houses with closed eaves (both locations), with horses tethered outside (village only) and with increasing room height (town only), but increased with additional people in the trapping room and where cows were tethered outside (both locations). Conclusion. The findings of this study advocate eave closure and pit latrine treatment in all locations, and zooprophylaxis using horses in rural areas, as simple control measures that could reduce the number of culicines found indoors.},

	doi = {https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-7-2},
	abstract = {Background. In the pre-intervention year of a randomized controlled trial investigating the protective effects of house screening against malaria-transmitting vectors, a multi-factorial risk factor analysis study was used to identify factors that influence mosquito house entry. Methods. Mosquitoes were sampled using CDC light traps in 976 houses, each on one night, in Farafenni town and surrounding villages during the malaria-transmission season in The Gambia. Catches from individual houses were both (a) left unadjusted and (b) adjusted relative to the number of mosquitoes caught in four sentinel houses that were operated nightly throughout the period, to allow for night-to-night variation. Houses were characterized by location, architecture, human occupancy and their mosquito control activities, and the number and type of domestic animals within the compound. Results. 106,536 mosquitoes were caught, of which 55\% were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, the major malaria vectors in the region. There were seven fold higher numbers of An. gambiae s.l. in the villages (geometric mean per trap night = 43.7, 95\% confidence intervals, CIs = 39.5-48.4) than in Farafenni town (6.3, 5.7-7.2) and significant variation between residential blocks (p {\textless} 0.001). A negative binomial multivariate model performed equally well using unadjusted or adjusted trap data. Using the unadjusted data the presence of nuisance mosquitoes was reduced if the house was located in the town (odds ratio, OR = 0.11, 95\% CIs = 0.09-0.13), the eaves were closed (OR = 0.71, 0.60-0.85), a horse was tethered near the house (OR = 0.77, 0.73-0.82), and churai, a local incense, was burned in the room at night (OR = 0.56, 0.47-0.66). Mosquito numbers increased per additional person in the house (OR = 1.04, 1.02-1.06) or trapping room (OR = 1.19, 1.13-1.25) and when the walls were made of mud blocks compared with concrete (OR = 1.44, 1.10-1.87). Conclusion. This study demonstrates that the risk of malaria transmission is greatest in rural areas, where large numbers of people sleep in houses made of mud blocks, where the eaves are open, horses are not tethered nearby and where churai is not burnt at night. These factors need to be considered in the design and analysis of intervention studies designed to reduce malaria transmission in The Gambia and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. © 2008 Kirby et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Tick species, in decreasing order of abundance, were: Boophilus geigy, Rhipicephalus senegalensis, B.decoloratus, Hyalaomma truncatum, H.marginatum rufipes and Amblyomma variegatum. All tick species peaked during the rainy season. Additional B.geigy peaks occurred towards the end of the dry season. The most infested animal body areas were anogenital, udder and abdomen. A.variegatum, Hyalomma spp. and, to a lesser extent, Boophilus spp. showed strong preferences for these anatomical regions. Overall prevalence of A.marginale, B.bigemina and B.bovis haemoparasites were 3.2\%, 0.9\% and 0.1\%, respectively. Peaks of A.marginale and B.bigemina occurred at the end of the rainy season-beginning of the dry season; an additional A.marginale peak was observed at mid-end dry season. Overall antibody seroprevalence were 29.6\% for A.marginale, 44.7\% for B.bigemina and 5.2\% for B.bovis; monthly fluctuations in percentage of seroreactors were limited. Endemic stability for A.marginale and B.bigemina is postulated. Implications of the outcomes are discussed in relation to tick-control strategy in The Gambia.},

A total of 605 anophelines, including 281A. gambiae and 301 A. arabiensis, were captured, 32.2\% in the human-baited traps and 67.8\% in bovine-baited traps. 30.3\% of A. gambiae fed in the former and 69.7\% fed in the latter; the corresponding figures for A. arabiensis were 29.6\% and 70.4\%. Thus, when the hosts were located outdoors and made equally available, the feeding preferences of A. gambiae and A. arabiensis were similar (P = 0.81). These results suggest that biases existed in previous studies, most of which suggested that A. arabiensis was more zoophilic than A. gambiae.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anarchic and poorly controlled urbanization led to an increased risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in many African cities. Here, we evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of human exposure to malaria and arboviral disease vectors in an urban area of northern Senegal, using antibody-based biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles and Aedes mosquito bites., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken during the rainy season of 2014 in 4 neighborhoods of Saint-Louis, a city in northern Senegal. Among children aged 6-59 months in each neighborhood, the dried blood spot technique was used to evaluate immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to both gSG6-P1 (Anopheles) and Nterm-34-kDa (Aedes) salivary peptides as validated biomarkers of respective mosquito bite exposure., RESULTS: IgG response levels to gSG6-P1 and Nterm-34-kDa salivary peptides varied significantly between the 4 neighborhoods (P {\textless} .0001). The level of exposure to Aedes bites also varied according to household access to sanitation services (P = .027), whereas that of exposure to Anopheles bites varied according to insecticide-treated bed net use (P = .006). In addition, spatial clusters of high contact between humans and mosquitoes were identified inside 3 neighborhoods., CONCLUSIONS: Antibody-based biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles and Aedes mosquito bites could be helpful tools for evaluating the heterogeneity of exposure to malaria and arboviral disease vectors by national control programs.

During the rainy season, the peak period of malaria transmission, breeding sites were 70\% more likely to have anopheline larvae in the floodplain of the Gambia River than upland sites (P {\textless} 0.001). However, mosquitoes were found in some examples of all habitats, apart from moving water. Habitats most often colonized by anopheline larvae were the largest water bodies, situated near the landward edge of the flood-plain, where culicine larvae were present. In the wet season, 49\% of sites had anophelines versus 19\% in the dry season (P {\textless} 0.001). Larval control targeted at specific habitats is unlikely to be successful in this setting. Nonetheless, larval control initiated at the end of the dry season and run throughout the rainy season could help reduce transmission.},

To be used as forecasting tools over large areas, such models could benefit from integrating remote sensing data that describe the meteorological and environmental conditions driving mosquito population dynamics. The main objective of this study is to assess a process-based modeling framework for mosquito population dynamics using satellite-derived meteorological estimates as input variables. A generic weather-driven model of mosquito population dynamics was applied to Rift Valley fever vector species in northern Senegal, with rainfall, temperature, and humidity as inputs. The model outputs using meteorological data from ground weather station vs satellite-based estimates are compared, using longitudinal mosquito trapping data for validation at local scale in three different ecosystems. Model predictions were consistent with field entomological data on adult abundance, with a better fit between predicted and observed abundances for the Sahelian Ferlo ecosystem, and for the models using in-situ weather data as input. Based on satellite-derived rainfall and temperature data, dynamic maps of three potential Rift Valley fever vector species were then produced at regional scale on a weekly basis. When direct weather measurements are sparse, these resulting maps should be used to support policy-makers in optimizing surveillance and control interventions of Rift Valley fever in Senegal.},

	abstract = {Urban settings often present low densities of mosquito vectors which do not allow to accurately assess the risk of arthropod-borne diseases based on entomological parameters. This study aims to evaluate the spatial risk of both malaria and arbovirus transmission in a northern urban area of Senegal, West-Africa, using antibody-based biomarkers of human exposure to Anopheles and Aedes mosquito bites. A cross-sectional study was undertaken between August and September 2014 (rainy season) in four urban districts (UDs) of the city of Saint-Louis, Senegal: Leona (LEO), Ndioloffene (NDI), Guet Ndar (GND) and Pikine Sor Diagne (PSD). In each UD, dry blood spots were performed in 809 children aged 6-59 months and ELISA method was used to evaluate IgG antibody (Ab) responses to both gSG6-P1 (Anopheles) and Nterm-34kDa (Aedes) peptides of respective mosquito saliva. The median of IgG response levels to both gSG6-P1 and Nterm-34kDa salivary peptide varied significantly according to UDs and were lower in LEO compared to PSD, GND and NDI (p{\textless}0.0001). Heat maps of IgG responses to both salivary peptides indicated variations in the spatial distribution of the intensity of Ab responses inside UDs. There were no hot spots of malaria transmission risk (areas with children presenting a high IgG intensity) in LEO. Hot spots of malaria were mainly located in the northern part of NDI and GND, and in the southern part of PSD. As for the risk of arbovirus transmission, there were no hot spots in LEO and PSD. Hot spots of arbovirus transmission risk were located in some patch in the north of NDI and were dispersed throughout the UD of GND. Our results demonstrate that hot spots of both malaria and arbovirus transmission risk actually exist in northern parts of NDI and GND. This highlights that a targeted fight against mosquitoes in these hot spots could be effective against all mosquito-borne diseases. Antibody-based biomarkers could then help national control programs to target and prioritize vector control strategies in areas with common risk of malaria and arbovirus transmission.},

T. congolense is pathogenic to cattle and the small ruminants but not to pigs, while T. simiae causes disease only in pigs. The two species are difficult to distinguish from each other because both share the same developmental cycle in the tsetse and are broadly similar morphologically. However, their isoenzyme and DNA characteristics are quite different. Even more confusing is the fact that T. congolense itself is composed of a number of "strains", or types; historically the different types of T. congolense were often considered as separate species by different workers. Now isoenzyme and DNA charaterization show that T. congolense is composed of at least three different types, which are probably equivalent to subspecies. Furthermore, evidence for another species within the subgenus Nannomonas has come recently from isolates from tsetse midguts in The Gambia. Specific DNA probes have now been produced for the different kinds of Nannomonas. With these, it is now possible to identify the different infections from midgut dissections of wild tsetse. This should now facilitate an elaborate study to determine the distribution and prevalence of the different types across Africa, their association with the different species of tsetse, and the significance of each in the causation of disease in domestic livestock. The information gained will also help clarify the taxonomic status of each type within the subgenus.},

	abstract = {In West Africa, tick-borne relapsing fever is due to the spirochete Borrelia crocidurae and its geographic distribution is classically limited to the Sahel and Saharan regions where the vector tick Alectorobius sonrai is distributed. We report results of epidemiologic investigations carried out in the Sudan savanna of Senegal where the existence of the disease was unknown. A two-year prospective investigation of a rural community indicated that 10\% of the study population developed an infection during the study period. Transmission patterns of B. crocidurae to humans and the small wild mammals who act as reservoirs for infection were similar to those previously described in the Sahel region. Examination of 1,197 burrows and blood samples from 2,531 small mammals indicated a considerable spread of the known area of distribution of A. sonrai and B. crocidurae. The actual spread of the vector and the disease has affected those regions where the average rainfall, before the start of the extended drought in West Africa, reached up to 1,000 mm and corresponds to the movement of the 750-mm isohyet toward the south from 1970 to 1992. Our findings suggest that the persistence of sub-Saharan drought, allowing the vector to colonize new areas in the Sudan savanna of West Africa, is probably responsible for a considerable spread of tick-borne borreliosis in this part of Africa.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever is an emerging mosquito-borne disease that represents a threat to human and animal health. The exophilic and exophagic behavior of the two main vector in West Africa (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes), adverse events post-vaccination, and lack of treatment, render ineffective the disease control. Therefore it is essential to develop an information system that facilitates decision-making and the implementation of adaptation strategies. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are linked with abnormally high rainfall, and can be predicted up to 5 months in advance by modeling approaches using climatic and environmental parameters. However, the application of these models in West Africa remains unsatisfactory due to a lack of data for animal and human cases and differences in the dynamics of the disease emergence and the vector species involved in transmission. Models have been proposed for West Africa but they were restricted to rainfall impact analysis without a spatial dimension. In this study, we developed a mixed Bayesian statistical model to evaluate the effects of climatic and ecological determinants on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the two main vectors. Adult mosquito abundance data were generated from July to December every fortnight in 2005-2006 at 79 sites, including temporary ponds, bare soils, shrubby savannah, wooded savannah, steppes, and villages in the Barkedji area. The results demonstrate the importance of environmental factors and weather conditions for predicting mosquito abundance. The rainfall and minimum temperature were positively correlated with the abundance of Cx. poicilipes, whereas the maximum temperature had negative effects. The rainfall was negatively correlated with the abundance of Ae. vexans. After combining land cover classes, weather conditions, and vector abundance, our model was used to predict the areas and periods with the highest risks of vector pressure. This information could support decision-making to improve RVF surveillance activities and to implement better intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Procurement of sterile tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis) from Burkina Faso for an eradication programme in Senegal that incorporates the sterile insect technique (SIT) required the development of transport and handling protocols that would allow retaining the female flies in the rearing facility and transport of the male flies as irradiated pupae. The proposed handling scheme included the chilling of the male pupae after the female emergence and transport to Senegal under low temperatures. The effect of exposing male pupae of G. p. gambiensis to low temperature immediately prior to emergence was investigated. Method(s): The parameters of interest were emergence rate, insemination potential, survival of adult male, male ability to participate in mating activities and productivity of females mated with these males. Production was assessed in laboratory rearing cages and mating behaviour in field cages. Male flies that emerged after the female emergence flush from pupae stored at 10degreeC or 12.5degreeC for 5 or 7 days were used in the investigations with flies that emerged under standard colony conditions as control. Males that were 3, 6 or 9 days old competed for mating opportunities with 3 day old females. Result(s): The emergence of males after storage of pupae at low temperature (10degreeC and 12.5degreeC) for 3, 5, or 7 days was similar to those kept under standard colony conditions while emergence of flies stored at 15degreeC started before the storage period was over. Survival of males that emerged from pupae stored at low temperature for varying periods was more than 60\% at 30 days post emergence (control more than 75\%). The fecundity of females inseminated by males that emerged from pupae stored at low temperature for varying periods ranged from 0.33+/-0.16 to 0.73+/-0.04 pupae per female per 10 days (control 0.60+/-0.16). The older males, irrespective of treatment, out-competed the younger males and 3 day-old males transferred lower amounts of seminal contents to the females. Conclusion(s): Storage of male pupae at low temperature for periods up to 7 days at the end of the male pupal period could not be directly associated with impairment of mating activity.Copyright © 2014 Voronin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The government of Senegal has embarked on a project to eliminate this tsetse species, and African animal trypanosomoses, from the Niayes area using an area-wide integrated pest management approach. A stratified entomological sampling strategy was therefore developed using spatial analytical tools and mathematical modeling. A preliminary phytsociological census identified eight types of suitable habitat, which could be discriminated from LandSat 7 ETM+ satellite images and denominated wet areas. At the end of March 2009, 683 unbaited Vavoua traps had been deployed, and the observed infested area in the Niayes was 525 km(2). In the remaining area, a mathematical model was used to assess the risk that flies were present despite a sequence of zero catches. The analysis showed that this risk was above 0.05 in 19\% of this area that will be considered as infested during the control operations. The remote sensing analysis that identified the wet areas allowed a restriction of the area to be surveyed to 4\% of the total surface area (7,150 km(2)), whereas the mathematical model provided an efficient method to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the sampling protocol. The final size of the control area will be decided based on the entomological collection data. This entomological sampling procedure might be used for other vector or pest control scenarios.},

Mosquitoes were captured as they attacked man in the open and in experimental huts which comprised 1.8 m cube frames with corrugated iron roofs and plywood walls of various heights. Catches of all species were similar in the open and in a roofed, but unwalled, hut frame. The mosquitoes taken in catches in unwalled huts and others with wall heights of 0.6, 1.2 and 1.7 m (giving an 8 cm eaves-level entry slit) fell into two categories. The first group, which included the endophilic species Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l., An. melas Theobald and Mansonia spp. were only slightly affected by increasing wall height, but the second group, including the exophilic mosquitoes Aedes spp., An. pharoensis Theobald, Cx poicilipes (Theobald) and Cx thalassius Theobald showed a very marked progressive exclusion. In comparisons of catches in two huts with 8 cm entry slits at eaves or ground level, large numbers of An. pharoensis found access through the ground level entry but not at eaves level. No consistent difference could be demonstrated for other species. It is concluded that the house-entering behaviour which distinguishes endophagic mosquito species includes at least two distinct responses: flight upwards to eaves level and the passage from outside to indoors. It is also suggested that house entry as a component in host-seeking behaviour and indoor resting are distinct, but not necessarily exclusive, behavioural traits.},

Density estimations of larvae at stage I to IV did not significantly differed using dipping or quadrat methods. On the contrary, pupal density was underestimated when measured by dipping. Mosquito nets placed over wells increased significantly emergence rate of adults, thus measurement of emerging mosquitoes was possible only the first day following the net putting up. The total number of immature stages in each well was significantly correlated with the number of emergent mosquitoes. The mean number of mosquitoes emerging daily from one well corresponded to 5 \% of the total number of immature stages. Stage distribution for larvae I to IV and pupae, estimated by quadrat, was respectively 29 \%, 28 \%, 22 \%, 16 \% et 5 \% (total = 100 \%). Taking account the mean duration of various immature stages and the number of emerging mosquitoes by day, the equation of the survivorship curve from larval hatch (excluded) io emergence included was : y = 427.2 - 136.8 log x. Therefore the mean mortality at immature stages was 80\% i.e, on emerging rate of 20 \%. The results of this study, associated with those of previous ones, permit to evaluate the average productivity of malaria Vectors in market-gardener wells in the Dakar area.},

	abstract = {Isolations of sylvatic dengue-2 virus from mosquitoes, humans and non-human primates in Senegal show synchronized multi-annual dynamics over the past 50 years. Host demography has been shown to directly affect the period between epidemics in other pathogen systems, therefore, one might expect unsynchronized multi-annual cycles occurring in hosts with dramatically different birth rates and life spans. However, in Senegal, we observe a single synchronized eight-year cycle across all vector species, suggesting synchronized dynamics in all vertebrate hosts. In the current study, we aim to explore two specific hypotheses: 1) primates with different demographics will experience outbreaks of dengue at different periodicities when observed as isolated systems, and that coupling of these subsystems through mosquito biting will act to synchronize incidence; and 2) the eight-year periodicity of isolations observed across multiple primate species is the result of long-term cycling in population immunity in the host populations. To test these hypotheses, we develop a multi-host, multi-vector Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model to explore the effects of coupling multiple host-vector systems of dengue virus transmission through cross-species biting rates. We find that under small amounts of coupling, incidence in the host species synchronize. Long-period multi-annual dynamics are observed only when prevalence in troughs reaches vanishingly small levels ({\textless} 10(-10)), suggesting that these dynamics are inconsistent with sustained transmission in this setting, but are consistent with local dengue virus extinctions followed by reintroductions. Inclusion of a constant introduction of infectious individuals into the system causes the multi-annual periods to shrink, while the effects of coupling remain the same. Inclusion of a stochastic rate of introduction allows for multi-annual periods at a cost of reduced synchrony. Thus, we conclude that the eight-year period separating amplifications of dengue may be explained by cycling in immunity with stochastic introductions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species of the Tabanidae are potent vectors of human and animal diseases, but they have not been thoroughly investigated to date. In Senegal (West Africa), little information is available on these dipterans. Our objective in this study was to investigate Senegalese tabanids and their diversity by using molecular and proteomics approaches, as well as their associated pathogens., METHODS: A total of 171 female tabanids were collected, including 143 from Casamance and 28 from Niokolo-Koba. The samples were identified morphologically by PCR sequencing and by MALDI-TOF MS, and PCR analysis was employed for pathogen detection and blood-meal characterization., RESULTS: The morphological identification revealed four species concordantly with the molecular identification: Atylotus fuscipes (79.5\%), Tabanus guineensis (16.4\%), Chrysops distinctipennis (3.5\%) and Tabanus taeniola (0.6\%) (not identified by PCR). The molecular investigation of pathogens revealed the presence of Trypanosoma theileri (6.6\%), Leishmania donovani (6.6\%), Setaria digitata (1.5\%), Rickettsia spp. (5.1\%) and Anaplasmataceae bacteria (0.7\%) in A. fuscipes. Tabanus guineensis was positive for L. donovani (35.7\%), S. digitata (3.6\%) and Anaplasmataceae (17.8\%). Leishmania donovani has been detected in 50\% of C. distinctipennis specimens and the only T. taeniola specimen. No Piroplasmida, Mansonella spp. or Coxeilla burnetii DNA was detected. In addition to humans (96.43\%), Chlorocebus sabeus, a non-human primate, has been identified as a host of (3.57\%) analysed tabanids. MALDI-TOF MS enabled us to correctly identify all tabanid species that had good quality spectra and to create a database for future identification., CONCLUSIONS: Tabanids in Senegal could be vectors of several pathogens threatening animal and public health. To fully characterize these dipterans, it is therefore necessary that researchers in entomology and infectiology employ molecular characterization and mass spectrometric techniques such as MALDI-TOF MS to analyse these dipterans in Senegal and West Africa.},

Mosquitoes were collected every two weeks with CDC light traps with dry ice at 79 sites including temporary ponds, barren, shrubby savannah, wooded savannah, steppes, and villages at different distances (between 0 and 600 m) from the nearest pond. The temporal distributions of these vectors varied between 2005 and 2006 and were positively correlated with rainfall for Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans Patton, with rainfall after a lag time of one month for Culex (Culex) poicilipes (Theobald) and Culex (Culex) neavei Theobald. All the vectors had their highest abundances and parity rates between September and November. The highest vector abundances were observed in the barren and temporary ponds. The distance of trap location to the nearest ponds was negatively correlated to the abundance of the vectors. Taking into account the linear regression equations, it was predicted that mosquitoes would not disperse and be collected by the light trap, up to 1,500 m to the nearest ponds. The implications of these findings in the epidemiology and control of RVF and WNF at Barkedji are discussed. Copyright © 2011 The Society for Vector Ecology.},

	abstract = {In the vicinity of the Barkedji village (in the Ferlo region of Senegal), the abundance and aggressiveness of the vector mosquitoes for Rift Valley fever (RVF) are strongly linked to rainfall events and associated ponds dynamics. Initially, these results were obtained from spectral analysis of high-resolution ({\textasciitilde}10 m) Spot-5 images, but, as a part of the French AdaptFVR project, identification of the free water dynamics within ponds was made with the new high-resolution (down to 3-meter pixels), Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite (TerraSAR-X) produced by Infoterra GmbH, Friedrichshafen/Potsdam, Germany. During summer 2008, within a 30 x 50 km radar image, it was found that identified free water fell well within the footprints of ponds localized by optical data (i.e. Spot-5 images), which increased the confidence in this new and complementary remote sensing technique. Moreover, by using near real-time rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), NASA/JAXA joint mission, the filling-up and flushing-out rates of the ponds can be accurately determined. The latter allows for a precise, spatio-temporal mapping of the zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes capable of revealing the variability of pond surfaces. The risk for RVF infection of gathered bovines and small ruminants ({\textasciitilde}1 park/km(2)) can thus be assessed. This new operational approach (which is independent of weather conditions) is an important development in the mapping of risk components (i.e. hazards plus vulnerability) related to RVF transmission during the summer monsoon, thus contributing to a RVF early warning system.},

Trypanosome (Trypanosoma congonlense and Trypanosoma vivax) infection rate in flies was 2.4 (s.e. 0.37)\%. Tsetse challenge index was 17.3 (s.e. 4.18). Mean monthly trypanosome prevalence in cattle was 2.5 (s.e. 0.51)\%. Highest trypanosome prevalence occurred during the dry season, and animals less than 1-year old were more frequently infected than older animals. The linear relationship between the log10+1 tsetse challenge and the arcsine of the trypanosome prevalence was significant only when mean monthly values of these variables over the 4-year period were used with tsetse challenge preceding infection rate by 3 months. Mean monthly prevalence of strongyle, Strongyloides spp., Toxocara spp. and coccidia were 34.4 (s.e. 0.60), 2.1 (s.e. 0.18), 1.2 (s.e. 0.45) and 15.6 (s.e. 0.47)\%, respectively.

Many consider HAT as one of the major neglected tropical diseases and AAT as the single greatest health constraint to increased livestock production. This review provides some background information on the taxonomy of tsetse flies, their unique way of reproduction (adenotrophic viviparity) making the adult stage the only one easily accessable for control, and how their ecological affinities, their distribution and population dynamics influence and dictate control efforts. The paper likewise reviews four control tactics (sequential aerosol technique, stationary attractive devices, live bait technique and the sterile insect technique) that are currently accepted as friendly to the environment, and describes their limitations and advantages and how they can best be put to practise in an IPM context. The paper discusses the different strategies for tsetse control i.e. localised versus area-wide and focusses thereafter on the principles of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) and the phased-conditional approach with the tsetse project in Senegal as a recent example. We argue that sustainable tsetse-free zones can be created on Africa mainland provided certain managerial and technical prerequisites are in place.

However, this index masks variation in the force of infection between herds and among individuals within herds. It is also not comparable between sites since the relative abundance of tsetse to hosts may vary. We have studied spatial distribution of herds of cattle in relation to tsetse in The Gambia and calculated an index of challenge based on the ratio of vectors to hosts over the livestock ranging area. This index is strongly correlated with estimates of the force of infection calculated from the incidence of infection in susceptible zebu; and it provides information on heterogeneity in exposure of different herds to tsetse.},

From an epidemiological point of view, it is of interest to know whether some genotypes of the vector are specialized in carrying certain genotypes of the pathogen. Findings: Thirty-five O. sonrai ticks collected in Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco confirmed to be B. crocidurae-infected, were genotyped by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. B. crocidurae was genotyped by Multispacer Sequence Typing. The 35 O. sonrai ticks grouped into 12 genotypes with strong geographical structuration. MST resolved the 35 B. crocidurae isolates into 29 genotypes with pairwise divergence of 0.09-1.56 \% without strict geographical structuration as genotype ST22 was found in Mali, Senegal and Mauritania. There was no evidence of tick-borrelia specialization as one O. sonrai genotype carried several B. crocidurae genotypes and one B. crocidurae genotype was found in different O. sonrai genotypes.

	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {The Anopheles gambiae complex includes mosquito species at different stages of speciation, ranging from clearly defined, although morphologically indistinguishable, bonae species to closely-related sympatric taxa such as An. gambiae and An. coluzzii (recently raised to formal species), which represent the major vectors of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Extensive genetic studies have trusted these species as models of ecological speciation and highlighted the effect of this process in malaria epidemiology and control. We sampled An. gambiae and An. coluzzii populations from diverse habitats along the Gambia River (West Africa), an area characterized by higher level of inter-specific hybridization compared to most of the species range. We carried out a comparative analysis of these samples by presumably neutral nuclear microsatellite markers on chromosome-X and -3 and by presumably adaptive chromosomal paracentric inversions on chromosome-2. Both genetic markers reveal unexpected striking genetic differences, compatible with a strong reduction of gene-flow, between An. gambiae populations west and east of the central part of the transect, apparently exclusively colonized by An. coluzzii. While An. gambiae western populations are characterized by low chromosomal inversion diversity, a very high degree of chromosomal variation, based on a higher number of inversion polymorphisms, is observed in eastern populations. Consistent with this chromosomal divergence, high genetic differentiation at the microsatellite level, not explained by geographic distance alone, is observed between western and eastern populations. Notably, this microsatellite differentiation is higher than that observed between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii, and mostly due to loci in the centromeric region of chromosome-X. This suggests that the two An. gambiae populations may be at an advanced stage of reproductive isolation, likely triggered by human-made habitat fragmentation, and provides new evidence of a speciation continuum within the Anopheles gambiae complex.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a high malaria incidence has been reported in urban and peri-urban areas of Senegal. An urban landscape analysis was conducted in three cities to assess vector species composition, behavior, and density as well as transmission factors to guide the optimal deployment of vector control interventions. Entomological monitoring using human landing catches (252 person-nights), pyrethrum spray catches (420 rooms), and mosquito habitat mapping was conducted from May to December 2019 in Diourbel, Kaolack, and Touba, the most populated cities in Senegal after the capital Dakar. Additionally, a household survey was conducted in 1,202 randomly selected houses to assess house structures, sleeping spaces, sleeping behavior, and population knowledge of malaria and vector control measures. Of the 8,240 Anopheles mosquitoes collected in all sites, 99.4\% (8,191) were An. gambiae s.l., specifically An. arabiensis (99\%). The average human biting rate [14.2 bites/person/night (b/p/n)] was higher outdoors (15.9 b/p/n) than indoors (12.5 b/p/n) and average entomological inoculation rates ranged from 3.7 infectious bites per person per year (ib/p/y) in Diourbel to 40.2 ib/p/y in Kaolack. Low anthropophilic rate was recorded at all sites (average 35.7\%). Of the 56 permanent larval habitats monitored during the rainy and the dry seasons, 80\% (8/10) in Diourbel, 67\% (12/18) in Kaolack and 43\% (12/28) in Touba were productive throughout both seasons. Additionally, more than 86\% of household members slept outdoors with insecticide treated nets except during the short rainy season despite having an understanding of how malaria is transmitted and the vector control measures that can prevent it. In conclusion, An. arabiensis is the primary malaria vector in urban Senegal with sustained permanent larval habitats found throughout the rainy and dry seasons. Since malaria vectors bite more frequently outdoors than indoors, and 86\% of households sleep outdoors, these data call for complementary tools and approaches for malaria vector control.},

Range expansion of invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus, and colonization of urban habitats by sylvatic and peridomestic Aedes vectors, are likely to alter the diseases' epidemiology.

	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {Biosurveillance is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting biosphere data in order to provide early detection of biological threats to human health. Obtaining meaningful samples for surveillance, particularly human blood, has limited pathogen detection in many underdeveloped countries. Therefore, we explored the possibility of exploiting the intrinsic host-feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheline mosquitoes to enhance biosurveillance efforts. Earlier studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this approach. Specifically, human papillomavirus was detected in field collected mosquito pools during a metagenomics analysis of the mosquito virome. In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was detected in engorged mosquitoes from a poultry farm in Thailand by RT-PCR. In this study we aimed to define the limitations of this approach in the laboratory and determine its potential application in the field. We hypothesize that blood-fed mosquitoes can be used in surveillance and discovery of pathogens in underdeveloped countries. To test this, colonized Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were fed on blood containing serial dilutions of chikungunya, influenza A, West Nile, Pirital, and human immunodeficiency-1 viruses. Twelve hours later the contents of the mosquito midguts were pressed onto filter paper to inactivate the virus and preserve the nucleic acids. The limits of viral RNA detection by RT-PCR were between 10 and 100 genome equivalents per microliter of fed virus. Additionally, we could differentiate between human, dog, cow, and sheep blood meals using multiplexed PCR. The samples will be further assessed for detection limits using deep sequencing. In August of 2012 our pathogen surveillance system was evaluated using blood fed An. mosquitoes collected at dawn from homes in Bandafassi, Senegal. Preliminary deep sequencing results of the mosquito blood meals revealed the presence of RNA homologous to herpes simplex virus type 2 and several Plasmodium species. We have demonstrated that this is a creative solution to overcome the technical and logistical obstacles, such as training local health professionals and maintaining sample cold-chain, for acquiring human blood for pathogen surveillance.},

	abstract = {Tsetse flies (Diptera, Glossinidae) transmit human and animal trypanosomoses in Africa, respectively a neglected human disease (sleeping sickness) and the most important constraint to cattle production in infested countries (nagana). We recently developed a methodology to map landscape friction (i.e. resistance to movement) for tsetse in West Africa. The goal was to identify natural barriers to tsetse dispersal, and potentially isolated tsetse populations for targeting elimination programmes. Most species distribution models neglect landscape functional connectivity whereas environmental factors affecting suitability or abundance are not necessarily the same as those influencing gene flows. Geographic distributions of a given species can be seen as the intersection between biotic (B), abiotic (A) and movement (M) factors (BAM diagram). Here we show that the suitable habitat for Glossina palpalis gambiensis as modelled by Maxent can be corrected by landscape functional connectivity (M) extracted from our friction analysis. This procedure did not degrade the specificity of the distribution model (P=0.751) whereas the predicted distribution area was reduced. The added value of this approach is that it reveals unconnected habitat patches. The approach we developed on tsetse to inform landscape connectivity (M) is reproducible and does not rely on expert knowledge. It can be applied to any species: we call for a generalization of the use of M to improve distribution models. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Glossina palpalis gambiensis (Diptera: Glossinidae) is a riverine species that is still present as an isolated metapopulation in the Niayes area of Senegal. It is targeted by a national eradication campaign combining a population reduction phase based on insecticide-treated targets (ITTs) and cattle and an eradication phase based on the sterile insect technique. In this study, we used species distribution models to optimize control operations. We compared the probability of the presence of G. p. gambiensis and habitat suitability using a regularized logistic regression and Maxent, respectively. Both models performed well, with an area under the curve of 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. Only the Maxent model predicted an expert-based classification of landscapes correctly. Maxent predictions were therefore used throughout the eradication campaign in the Niayes to make control operations more efficient in terms of deployment of ITTs, release density of sterile males, and location of monitoring traps used to assess program progress. We discuss how the models' results informed about the particular ecology of tsetse in the target area. Maxent predictions allowed optimizing efficiency and cost within our project, and might be useful for other tsetse control campaigns in the framework of the PATTEC and, more generally, other vector or insect pest control programs.},

In 2009, the first two human cases of USUV infection in Europe have been reported in Italy, causing encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. The host range in Africa includes mainly Culex mosquitoes, birds, and also humans with one benign and one severe case. Given its role as a potential human pathogen and the similar appearance compared with other emerging arboviruses, it is essential to investigate the natural history and ecology of USUV in Africa. In this regard, we review the emergence of USUV in Africa, summarizing data about isolations, host range, and potential vectors, which should help to improve our understanding of the factors underlying the circulation of USUV in Europe and Africa.},

	abstract = {Background: Vector competence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is a quantitative genetic trait that varies among geographic locations and among different flavivirus species and genotypes within species. The subspecies Ae. aegypti formosus, found mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, is considered to be refractory to both dengue (DENV) and yellow fever viruses (YFV) compared to the more globally distributed Ae. aegypti aegypti. Within Senegal, vector competence varies with collection site and DENV-2 viral isolate, but knowledge about the interaction of West African Ae. aegypti with different flaviviruses is lacking. The current study utilizes low passage isolates of dengue-2 (DENV-2-75505 sylvatic genotype) and yellow fever (YFV BA-55 West African Genotype I, or YFV DAK 1279-West African Genotype II) from West Africa and field derived Ae. aegypti collected throughout Senegal to determine whether vector competence is flavivirus or virus genotype dependent. Methodology/Principal Findings: Eight collections of 20-30 mosquitoes from different sites were fed a bloodmeal containing either DENV-2 or either isolate of YFV. Midgut and disseminated infection phenotypes were determined 14 days post infection. Collections varied significantly in the rate and intensity of midgut and disseminated infection among the three viruses. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, vector competence was dependent upon both viral and vector strains. Importantly, contrary to previous studies, sylvatic collections of Ae. aegypti showed high levels of disseminated infection for local isolates of both DENV-2 and YFV.},

	abstract = {Background: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae) is a mosquito-borne, zoonotic pathogen. In Senegal, RVFV was first isolated in 1974 from Aedes dalzieli (Theobald) and thereafter from Ae. fowleri (de Charmoy), Ae. ochraceus Theobald, Ae. vexans (Meigen), Culex poicilipes (Theobald), Mansonia africana (Theobald) and Ma. uniformis (Theobald). However, the vector competence of these local species has never been demonstrated making hypothetical the transmission cycle proposed for West Africa based on serological data and mosquito isolates. Methods: Aedes vexans and Cx. poicilipes, two common mosquito species most frequently associated with RVFV in Senegal, and Cx. quinquefasciatus, the most common domestic species, were assessed after oral feeding with three RVFV strains of the West and East/central African lineages. Fully engorged mosquitoes (420 Ae. vexans, 563 Cx. quinquefasciatus and 380 Cx. poicilipes) were maintained at 27 +/- 1 degrees C and 70-80 \% relative humidity. The saliva, legs/wings and bodies were tested individually for the RVFV genome using real-time RT-PCR at 5, 10, 15 and 20 days post exposure (dpe) to estimate the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. Genotypic characterisation of the 3 strains used were performed to identify factors underlying the different patterns of transmission. Results: The infection rates varied between 30.0-85.0 \% for Ae. vexans, 3.3-27 \% for Cx. quinquefasciatus and 8.3-46.7 \% for Cx. poicilipes, and the dissemination rates varied between 10.5-37 \% for Ae. vexans, 9.5-28.6 \% for Cx. quinquefasciatus and 3.0-40.9 \% for Cx. poicilipes. However only the East African lineage was transmitted, with transmission rates varying between 13.3-33.3 \% in Ae. vexans, 50 \% in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 11.1 \% in Cx. poicilipes. Culex mosquitoes were less susceptible to infection than Ae. vexans. Compared to other strains, amino acid variation in the NSs M segment proteins of the East African RVFV lineage human-derived strain SH172805, might explain the differences in transmission potential. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that all the species tested were competent for RVFV with a significant more important role of Ae. vexans compared to Culex species and a highest potential of the East African lineage to be transmitted.},

In West Africa, Culex neavei and Culex quinquefasciatus are considered as potential vectors for WN virus transmission in sylvatic or urban context. We analyzed the vector competence of these Culex species from Senegal for African lineages and envelope proteins sequences of viral strains used. We showed that lineage 1 is transmitted by both Culex mosquitoes, whereas the putative new lineage 8 is transmitted only by Cx. neavei. Our findings suggest that genetic variability can affect vector competence and depend on mosquito. However, when considering the infective life rate, the mosquito population seems to be inefficient for WN virus transmission in the field and could explain the low impact of WN virus in Africa.},

They have never been reported in Senegal until recently during a study in arbovirus emergence with the detection of a new species of MESOV named Dianke virus (DKV) from common mosquitoes from eastern Senegal. Actually, their vector competence for this newly described DKV is unknown. We, therefore, estimated the vector competence of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected in Senegal for DKV using oral infection. Whole bodies, legs/wings, and saliva samples were tested for DKV by RT-PCR to estimate infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. The infectivity of virus particles in the saliva was confirmed by infecting C6/36 cells. Virus transmission rates were up to 95.45\% in Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 28\% in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 9.09\% in Aedes aegypti. Viral particles in the saliva were confirmed infectious by C6/36 cell culture. An. gambiae was able to disseminate DKV only at 20 days post-infection. This study shows that Culex mosquitoes are more competent than Ae. aegypti for DKV, while Anopheles gambiae is not likely a competent vector.},

	abstract = {West Nile virus (WN virus) is one of the most widespread arbovirus and exhibits a great genetic diversity with 8 lineages, at least 4 (1, 2, Koutango, and putative new) are present in Africa. In West Africa, Culex neavei and Culex quinquefasciatus are considered as potential vectors for WN virus transmission in sylvatic or urban context. We analyzed the vector competence of these Culex species from Senegal for African lineages and envelope proteins sequences of viral strains used. We showed that lineage 1 is transmitted by both Culex mosquitoes, whereas the putative new lineage 8 is transmitted only by Cx. neavei. Our findings suggest that genetic variability can affect vector competence and depend on mosquito. However, when considering the infective life rate, the mosquito population seems to be inefficient for WN virus transmission in the field and could explain the low impact of WN virus in Africa.},

Pyrethrum spray collections were carried out along a 910-meter area starting from a district bordering on a permanent marsh and continuing into the center of the city. According to the distance from the marsh, vector density (the number of An. arabiensis per 100 rooms) at 0-160, 160-285, 285-410, 410-535, 535-660, 660-785, and 785-910 meters was 84, 40, 5, 2, 2, 0.4, and 0, respectively, during the dry season, and 414, 229, 110, 84, 99, 69, and 21, respectively, during the rainy season. The proportion of 8-11-year-old children with negative immunofluorescent antibody test results for Plasmodium falciparum was 17\%, 28\%, 44\%, 54\%, 50\%, 63\%, and 73\%, respectively, in these different sections. Malaria prevalence in the community was maximum in the area bordering on the marsh where it ranged from 1\% to 15\% (average 6\%) according to age and season of the year. These findings show the epidemiologic importance of vector density gradients in Dakar. The implications for malaria control in urban areas are discussed.},

The characteristics of the sylvatic transmission cycle are a circulation periodicity with silent intervals that last approximately three years. Few epidemics of this disease have been reported in Senegal. The most recent one occurred in 1996 in Kaffrine where two Chikungunya virus strains were isolated from Ae. aegypti. The retrospective analysis of viral isolates from mosquitoes, wild vertebrates, and humans allowed to us to characterize Chikungunya virus transmission cycles in Senegal and to compare them with those of yellow fever virus.},

We therefore used meta-genomics sequencing to search for viruses in adult Anopheles mosquitoes collected from Liberia, Senegal, and Burkina Faso. We identified a number of virus and virus-like sequences from mosquito midgut contents, including 14 coding-complete genome segments and 26 partial sequences. The coding-complete sequences define new viruses in the order Mononegavirales, and the families Flaviviridae, and Totiviridae. The identification of a flavivirus infecting Anopheles mosquitoes broadens our understanding of the evolution and host range of this virus family. This study increases our understanding of virus diversity in general, begins to define the virome of a medically important vector in its natural setting, and lays groundwork for future studies examining the potential impact of these viruses on anopheles biology and disease transmission.

WNV is endemic in Senegal, particularly in the Senegal River Delta. To assess transmission patterns and potential vectors, entomological and sentinel serological was done in Ross Bethio along the River Senegal. Three sentinel henhouses (also used as chicken-baited traps) were set at 100 m, 800 m, and 1,300 m from the river, the latter close to a horse-baited trap. Blood samples were taken from sentinel chickens at 2-week intervals. Seroconversions were observed in sentinel chickens in November and December. Overall, the serological incidence rate was 4.6\% with 95\% confidence interval (0.9; 8.4) in the sentinel chickens monitored for this study. Based on abundance pattern, Culex neavei was the most likely mosquito vector involved in WNV transmission to sentinel chickens, and a potential bridge vector between birds and mammals.},

	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {An entomological survey was conducted in the Gambia in January 1979, during the last phase of a yellow fever (YF) outbreak which began during the previous rainy season. In the dry conditions which prevailed in January, Aedes aegypti was the only YF vector present. Two YF virus strains were isolated from females of this mosquito species caught in a village of western Gambia, where active human cases were documented. The ae. aegypti breeding sites were exclusively of the domestic type. Larval indices varied greatly from place to place, but generally appeared to correlate with the incidence of disease. A better understanding of the conditions that prevailed at the onset and during the early phase of the epidemic will require further entomological investigations. Nevertheless, it appears probable that initial transmission as by sylvatic vectors such as the Ae. furcifer-taylori group and possibly others such as Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. metallicus, and Ae. vittatus. As the outbreak progressed, interhuman transmission by Ae. aegypti also occurred, and this mixed epidemiological pattern later gave way to transmission by Ae. aegypti only when sylvatic vector populations declined in the dry season. We speculate that a prolongation of the rainy season during 1976--1978 was important in the origin of the outbreak. The relationship of this epidemic to the established focus of sylvatic YF in southeastern Senegal is discussed. The Gambian outbreak is considered the result of a recent northwesterly extension of the YF Emergence Zone.},
