	abstract = {An abattoir survey of sheep and goats was carried out in The Gambia for one year. A total of 1248 goats and 438 sheep, predominantly young females, were slaughtered and sampled. Sixty per cent of the females of both species were pregnant. There were no significant differences between the dressing percentages of different breeds and age groups. Sex and stage of pregnancy had a significant influence on carcase yields in both species. In goats the highest carcase yields were obtained during the early dry season. Most of the animals were clinically healthy and there were few pathological findings postmortem. In both species, there was a seasonal fluctuation of packed cell volume (PCV), with a minimum during the rains, and although the prevalence of trypanosomiasis was low it reduced the PCV. Faecal egg counts of Trichostrongylidae were highest during the rainy season and goats had higher faecal egg and coccidial oocyst counts than sheep. In sheep, a breed difference was observed for PCV and an age difference for egg excretion. The peak or higher rates of egg excretion occurred during the rains in both species. The immune status against peste des petits ruminants was significantly lower in goats (39 per cent) than in sheep (49.5 per cent). Antibodies against bluetongue virus were found in 62.6 per cent of goats and 55.8 per cent of sheep.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis study analyzed the state of broiler production in Senegal after nearly two decades of poultry import restrictions. It provides a synopsis of the Senegalese broiler value chain and evaluates the performance and economics of different broiler farm types.Design/methodology/approachA multi-stakeholder workshop and interviews were conducted with key informants to investigate the structure and activities of the Senegalese broiler value chain. The typical farm approach (TFA) was used to construct and analyze "typical" farms that represent the most common broiler production systems in Senegal.FindingsThe current situation in the Senegalese broiler value chain is favorable for hatcheries, feed mills, producers and poultry traders. However, the slaughterhouses are not faring well. The farm economic analysis demonstrates that typical medium-scale broiler farms are performing well, due to the use of high-quality feed, chicks and good husbandry. Additionally, the analysis revealed that feed and day-old chick (DOC) costs are the most significant in conventional broiler production in Senegal. Despite the high costs of feed and DOCs, broiler production is profitable for typical farms.Research limitations/implicationsAthough this study provides detailed insights into broiler farm economics in Senegal, it does not include typical integrated large-scale broiler farm-types. Based on our findings, we can predict that such farm types may be more efficient and have lower production costs due to the use of high-quality inputs (chicks and feed), and economies of scale. However, future studies will need to verify this prediction.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, only a few unpublished studies on broiler farm economics in Senegal exist. These studies only provide a basic analysis of the cost of production and profitability, with little consideration of various production systems. Contrastingly, this study provides a detailed economic analysis of different types of conventional broiler farms in key production regions.},

	abstract = {The application of systems analysis techniques identified a number of key factors which will determine future developments in the Gambian livestock industry, with especial reference to traditionally managed trypanotolerant, N'dama cattle, and the importance of tsetse and trypanosomiasis. Different components of the analysis repeatedly identified the following key factors: human population growth; declining rainfall; loss of tree cover; trends in land-use including increased areas under cultivation, reduced fallowing and reduced access for grazing; livestock numbers; prices for groundnuts (the main cash crop) and cattle; and indicators of national wealth reflecting cash available to invest in livestock or to purchase livestock products. In many areas tsetse and trypanosomiasis appear to be in decline as a result of habitat destruction but they are likely to persist in others where trypanotolerant animals face a high risk of trypanosomiasis infection and active control may bring significant benefits. Several of the identified trends raise doubts concerning the long-term sustainability of traditional grazing on common land, although improved, intensive management strategies can do much to alleviate these problems.

	abstract = {Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) make nests for resting and sleeping, which is unusual for anthropoid primates but common to all great apes. Arboreal nesting has been linked to predation pressure, but few studies have tested the adaptive nature of this behavior. We collected data at two chimpanzee study sites in southeastern Senegal that differed in predator presence to test the hypothesis that elevated sleeping platforms are adaptations for predator defense. At Assirik in the Parc National du Niokolo-Koba, chimpanzees face four species of large carnivore, whereas at Fongoli, outside national park boundaries, humans have exterminated almost all natural predators. We quantified the availability of vegetation at the two sites to test the alternative hypothesis that differences in nesting reflect differences in habitat structure. We also examined possible sex differences in nesting behavior, community demographic differences, seasonality and nest age differences as variables also potentially affecting nest characteristics and nesting behavior between the two sites. Chimpanzees at Fongoli nested at lower heights and farther apart than did chimpanzees at Assirik and sometimes made nests on the ground. The absence of predators outside of the national park may account for the differences in nest characteristics at the two sites, given the similarities in habitat structure between Fongoli and Assirik. However, Fongoli chimpanzees regularly build arboreal nests for sleeping, even under minimal predation pressure, and this requires explanation.},

	abstract = {Background: Reports of natural infections of Schistosoma mansoni in a number of species of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Africa, coupled with the substantial overlap of NHP habitats and human schistosomiasis endemic areas, has led to concerns about the role of NHPs in the transmission of human schistosomiasis. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to describe the current scope of knowledge for Africa, for the NHP species implicated, their geographical distribution, infection rates with S. mansoni, and to discuss the implications for public health and conservation. Main text: A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization (WHO) library database, World Cat, and ScienceDirect without any language restriction. Studies examining S. mansoni infection of any African NHP species were included. Study types, primate species, their geographical distribution, and parasite diagnostic techniques reported in the studies were qualitatively summarized. Data for species with sample sizes {\textgreater}=10 were included in the meta-analysis. We assessed the reported infection rate, and used a random-effects model to estimate the summary infection rates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity among studies using the I 2 statistics. Twenty-nine publications, from 1960 to 2018, were identified and included in the review. The studies examined a total of 2962 primates belonging to 22 species in 11 genera across ten countries (Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and S. mansoni infections were found in nine species of five genera in all countries. When we excluded studies with sample sizes {\textless} 10, data from 24 studies on 11 species of primates in three genera in ten countries remained in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of infection rate was 10\% (95\% CI: 6-16\%) with high heterogeneity (I 2 = 94.77\%) across countries and species/genera. Among the three genera, Pan had the highest infection rate of 15\% (95\% CI: 0-55\%), followed by Papio at 11\% (95\% CI: 6-18\%), and Cercopithecus at 5\% (95\% CI: 0-14\%). The association between NHP and human infections was positive, but not significant, due to low study sample matches and high variation. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection rate is high in African NHPs, with substantial heterogeneities across species/genera and countries in Africa. Given the evidence for potential spillover and spillback of S. mansoni between African NHPs and humans, further research is urgently needed to understand ecology and mechanisms of transmission of the parasite between NHP and human hosts, in order to inform control strategies of this important neglected tropical disease.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

The article reports the AFP probability distributions calculated on goats and sheep herds monitored for more than 10 years in three low-input livestock farming systems located from northern to southern Senegal (Louga, Kaymor, and Kolda) and representing different agroecological conditions and animal phenotypes. The AFP distributions were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis accounting for censoring (females lost to follow-up before their first parturition). When measured by the KM estimator of the AFP median, the precocity for both species was almost 4 months later in Louga than in Kaymor and Kolda. In Louga, the precocity was 1.6 months later for sheep than for goats and 2.9 months in Kaymor and Kolda. These estimates were higher than those obtained with the common and crude approach that removes censored data before calculation (relative bias ranged from -12\% to -22\% for the AFP mean depending on species and site) and those already published in previous studies on the same data sets. In on-farm small ruminant studies focusing on reproductive traits such as AFP distributions, we recommend using survival models (e.g., the KM method) to avoid potential biases due to data censoring.},

	abstract = {The Senegalese delta, like many other agricultural territories in the Global South, is experiencing changes in agricultural trajectory. These changes are related to the promotion of competitive and performance-based forms of agriculture. In a context of tense relations between farmers and herders, the quest for equitable access to land, which is a guarantee of peace, stability, and balanced economic and social development, is being called into question by the arrival of capital investors and new actors that are highly supported by the State. This situation raises questions about two important issues: (i) the challenge of the sustainable management of natural resources, especially land; and (ii) the socio-political stakes related to the fact that land is a sensitive resource, both politically and socially. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that dominant discourses are being built around representation of unused and available lands. The aim of this article is to address this controversy by questioning land-use planning processes and tools and underlining the reality depicted. We demonstrate that discourses around land availability are built upon sectoral visions that tend to overshadow the realities of land use. Indeed, livestock farming and particularly its mobile form (i.e., pastoralism) is rendered invisible by not being considered in the majority of land-use and agricultural policies. Through a participatory survey of campsites, we show that gathering basic information on livestock farming should not to be reduced to technical issues. Beyond that, we acknowledge that these land-use issues are rooted in sector-based and neoliberal visions of development. We conclude by discussing the importance of effective decentralization in financial and technical means and the development of systemic proficiency that goes beyond normative sectoral views to acknowledge and act on territorial development.},

	abstract = {Generally rodents are found to be larger on islands than on the mainland. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, and the aim of this paper is to examine one of them. On the mainland of Senegal, Mastomys huberti occupies humid habitats. However, it occurs also on dry and sandy islands (Saloum delta), where its representatives are dwarf. Since water availability appeared to be the limiting factor in these islands when compared to the mainland, we studied water turnover characteristics in relation to body size, in mainland and island populations at the end of the dry season, under both field and laboratory conditions. All populations were found to be water balanced in their natural habitats. They presented similar rates of water turnover, even though island animals were subjected to stronger constraints than mainland ones. Laboratory experiments suggested that the physiological plasticity of one of the island populations may be reduced. Island populations have a higher kidney size to body weight ratio than those from the mainland. We propose that smaller size in the islands allows the maintenance of water balance with a smaller amount of water, and that a higher ratio of kidney filtration surface to body size may help Mastomys huberti to survive in dry islands. We discuss the factors responsible for body size variability and variation in water exchange characteristics and conclude that different factors could explain body size variation among island populations, depending on the species considered and the ecological constraints met within the islands.},

In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Given the relatively sophisticated cognitive abilities yet small brain size of living apes compared to humans and even early hominins, observations of wild chimpanzees' reactions to naturally occurring fire can help inform hypotheses about the likely responses of early hominins to fire. We use data on the behavior of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Fongoli, Senegal during two encounters with wildfires to illuminate the similarities between great apes and humans regarding their reaction to fire. Chimpanzees' close relatedness to our lineage makes them phylogenetically relevant to the study of hominid evolution, and the open, hot and dry environment at Fongoli, similar to the savanna mosaic thought to characterize much of hominid evolution, makes these apes ecologically important as a living primate model as well. Chimpanzees at Fongoli calmly monitor wildfires and change their behavior in anticipation of the fire's movement. The ability to conceptualize the "behavior" of fire may be a synapomorphic trait characterizing the human-chimpanzee clade. If the cognitive underpinnings of fire conceptualization are a primitive hominid trait, hypotheses concerning the origins of the control and use of fire may need revision. We argue that our findings exemplify the importance of using living chimpanzees as models for better understanding human evolution despite recently published suggestions to the contrary.

	abstract = {All great apes build nightly a structure ("nest" or "bed") that is assumed to function primarily as a sleeping-platform. However, several other nest function hypotheses have been proposed: antipredation, antipathogen, and thermoregulation. I tested these simple shelter functions of chimpanzee nests in an experiment for which I was the subject in Fongoli, Senegal. I slept 11 nights in chimpanzee nests and on the bare ground to test for differences in sleep quality, potential exposure to disease through bites from possible vectors, and insulation. No difference was found in the total amount of sleep nor in sleep quality; however, sleep was more disturbed on the ground. Differences in sleep disturbance between arboreal and ground conditions seemed primarily due to causes of anxiety and alertness, e.g., vocalizations of terrestrial mammals. Arboreal nest-sleeping seems to reduce risk of bites from possible disease vectors and provide insulation in cold conditions. This preliminary, but direct, test of chimpanzee nest function has implications for the evolutionary transition from limb-roosting to nest-reclining sleep in the hominoids, and from tree-to-ground sleep in the genus Homo.

	abstract = {Ten herd-level cross-sectional studies were conducted in peri-urban dairy production areas of seven West and Central African countries (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). The objectives were to estimate herd level Brucella spp. seroprevalence and identify risk factors for seropositivity. In each of the ten study areas, herds (between 52 and 142 per area, total = 965) were selected probabilistically and a structured questionnaire was administered to gather information on their structure and management. A bulk milk sample from each herd was tested by indirect ELISA for Brucella spp. For each area, herd seroprevalence estimates were obtained after adjusting for the assumed performance of the diagnostic test. Herd level risk factors for Brucella spp. seropositivity were identified by means of stratified logistic regression, with each peri-urban zone as a stratum. Area-specific models were also explored. Estimated herd seroprevalences were: Lome (Togo) 62.0\% (95\% CI:55.0-69.0), Bamako (Mali) 32.5\% (95\% CI:28.0-37.0), Bujumbura (Burundi) 14.7\% (95\%CI:9.4-20.8), Bamenda (Cameroon) 12.6\% (95\% CI:7.6-21.9), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) 3.0\% (95\% CI:1.0-9.1), Ngaoundere (Cameroon) 2.3\% (95\% CI:1.0-7.0), Thies (Senegal) 1.3\% (95\% CI:0.1, 5.3), Niamey (Niger) 1.2\% (95\% CI:0.08-5.3), Dakar (Senegal) 0.2\% (95\% CI:0.01-1.7) and Niakhar (Senegal) {\textless}0.04\%. Logistic regression modelling revealed transhumant herds to be at lower risk of infection (adjusted OR: 0.25, 95\% CI: 0.13 - 0.5) and in one of the areas (Bamenda), regular purchase of new animals was found to be strongly associated with Brucella spp. seropositivity (adjusted OR = 5.3, 95\% CI: 1.4-25.9). Our findings confirm that Brucella spp. circulates among dairy cattle supplying milk to urban consumers in West and Central Africa, posing a serious public health concern. Control programs are urgently needed in areas such as Lome or Bamako, where more than 30\% of the herds show evidence of infection.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is regarded as one of the highest burden zoonotic diseases to persist in many regions globally. While sustained vaccination against B. abortus in an endemic setting can markedly reduce the prevalence of large ruminant and human brucellosis and benefit local livelihoods, the implementation of effective and sustainable control programmes has often failed in the worst affected areas. In a cross-sectional study of 728 peri-urban dairy farmers in nine areas of six West and Central African countries, levels of commercialization and farm characteristics were examined alongside B. abortus seroprevalence estimates to hypothesize the most appropriate model for brucellosis vaccination delivery in each country. Demographic and economic data were collated and used to describe the farming systems currently in place. Furthermore, these data were utilized in a likelihood assessment to generate a quantitative score to hypothesize which of three private-public partnership (PPP) vaccine delivery models, that is 1) transformative, 2) transactional or 3) collaborative, would be most appropriate in each setting. The study sites had substantial differences in their levels of dairy commercialization and the farming practices employed; the heterogeneity across the study sites was evident in the conclusions of which models would be appropriate for vaccination delivery. While Lome (Togo) had a strong indication for a transformative PPP model, Burkina Faso had strong indication for the collaborative PPP model. Of the remaining study sites, the scores were less dominant for any one model with Cameroon and Ivory Coast sites only just scoring highest on the transformative model and Senegal and Mali sites only just scoring highest on the collaborative model. Interestingly, none of the countries included in the study scored highest on the transactional model which currently is the most commonplace delivery model in the majority of sub-Saharan African countries.},

Demographic changes that affect both the epidemiology of brucellosis and the success of control or surveillance are also considered. The evidence suggests that brucellosis prevalence in emerging periurban dairy cattle systems may be higher than that found in traditional transhumant extensive systems. Accurate microbiological and epidemiological evidence across the region is lacking but it appears there is inherent interest in controlling the disease.

This study describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of B. senegalensis and B. umbilicatus infestation by the Schistosoma haematobium group of blood flukes in Niakhar, Senegal. Molecular identification of the S. haematobium group was performed by real-time PCR, targeting the Dra 1 gene in 810 samples of Bulinus spp. collected during the schistosomiasis transmission season in 2013. In addition to Dra 1 PCR, a rapid diagnostic-PCR was performed on a sub-group of 43 snails to discriminate S. haematobium, S. bovis, and S. mattheei. Out of 810 snails, 236 (29.1\%) were positive for Dra 1 based on the PCR, including 96.2\% and 3.8\% of B. senegalensis and B. umbilicatus, respectively. Among the sub-group, 16 samples were confirmed to be S. haematobium while one was identified as a mixture of S. haematobium and S. bovis. Snails infestations were detected in all villages sampled and infestation rates ranged from 15.38\% to 42.11\%. The prevalence of infestation was higher in the north (33.47\%) compared to the south (25.74\%). Snail populations infestations appear early in the rainy season, with a peak in the middle of the season, and then a decline towards the end of the rainy season. Molecular techniques showed, for the first time, the presence of S. bovis in the Bulinus spp. population of Niakhar. The heterogeneity of snail infestations at the village level must be taken into account in mass treatment strategies. Further studies should help to improve the characterizations of the schistosome population.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.},

A study to assess practices, challenges and opportunities during rearing of less than 12-month-old calves in traditional cattle herds in the Peanut Basin of Senegal was carried out. Data were collected on 207 farms through farm visits and completion of a questionnaire. Categorical principal component analysis followed by two-step cluster analysis identified two cattle production systems: livestock based (LB: 47.83 \%) and livestock-crop based (LCB, 52.17 \%). On average, 2.81 +/- 0.15 calves were reared per farm. Calves were weaned at the age of 12.27 +/- 0.32 months. A majority of the calves were of indigenous breeds (71.37 \%) and were meant to serve as replacement stock (74.23 \%). The tropical livestock unit for cattle owned was significantly lower in LB compared to LCB farms (12.71 vs. 18.85). Significantly higher number of farmers owned non-indigenous calves, had clean calf rearing area and reported feed availability in LB farms as compared to LCB farms. A majority of farmers (98.50 \%) perceived calf morbidity and mortality as a major challenge in calf rearing. Meanwhile, labour was readily available to assist with calf rearing in 88.24 \% of farms in both systems.

Tsetse abundance at each study site was monitored throughout the study period from trap catches, and cattle censuses at each site were carried out on a monthly basis. Detailed ecological, productivity and health data, including dietary intake and trypanosomiasis prevalence, were collected from selected study herds resident at the two sites and from a third group of (four) herds that migrated annually between the two areas to spend the late dry season period in Niamina East. It was shown that the migration strategy allowed migrants to maintain a high level of green grazing in the diet throughout the year. Cattle were moved to the area of highest tsetse density in the region to obtain this grazing, but it appeared that individual risk of trypanosome infection was diminished by a dilution effect created by locally high livestock densities. Trypanosomiasis prevalences in resident cattle at Niamina East were best correlated with the tsetse catch/trap/day 2 months previously, once this index of tsetse abundance had been corrected to allow for changes in relative stocking density.},

This study presents the molecular epidemiology of NTS isolated from poultry in Senegal. Methodology: A total of 261 NTS recovered from broiler farms, chicken carcasses and street vendors were characterized using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) techniques. Results: We observed 20 distinct RAPD profiles corresponding to 18 different serotypes. Strains from each of these 20 groups were further analysed using MLST. Consequently, 12 new MLST alleles and 17 new sequence types were discovered. Three sequence types (S. Kentucky ST198, S. Agona ST13 and S. Istanbul ST33) have previously been described in Senegal and other countries, suggesting that these clones are geographically widely distributed and are circulating in a wide range of hosts. Nine clones showed multi-resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in both humans and animals. However, a novel multi-resistant clone of S. Kentucky ST832 was found. Conclusion: This study gives new insights into the genetic diversity of NTS in Senegal. Molecular tools remain essential to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of NTS by tracking the sources of infection and/or contamination.},

The national herd increased from 2010 to 2016, from 3.32 to 3.54 million head of cattle, 5.6 to 6.68 million sheep and 4.8 to 5.7 million goats, i.e. annual growth rates of 1.1\%, 3.2\% and 3.13\% respectively. Thus, due to diversification of local agricultural resources and the strengthening of goat breeding techniques in the Fatick area, a programme aiming to develop the local goat sector was set up in 2010. The programme focused on improving animal husbandry, providing new added values to goat products and structuring the goat sector. This study's aim is to better understand goat rearing systems in the area, in order to propose, together with the herders, ways of improving these systems, taking into account family and socio-cultural considerations. To better evaluate the diversity in different production systems, a survey of animal rearing practices was carried out. The survey involved 45 farmers in four localities. It revealed that the farmers were all agro-pastoralists practising a mixed farming system. The majority (93\%) supplemented their animals with agricultural by-products, agro-forestry and kitchen leftovers. A multiple correspondence analysis identified three groups: cluster 1 (milk producers and processors into traditional curdled milk, selling animals for household needs), cluster 2 (milk processors into yoghurt and cheese) and cluster 3 (goat vendors in pastoral and the agro-pastoral system). The study of the objectives and contexts of goat farming in the Fatick will enable policy-makers to design strategies for the sustainable development of family goat farming in the area.},

	abstract = {Domestic milk production has been for a long time hindered by many factors including lack of interest from decision makers, distorted economic policy and biotechnical constraints. For the last 20 years, many developing countries have been attempting to develop the domestic milk production sector. However, research on the basic realities and the viability status of enterprises within this sector remain largely unproved in many developing countries. This study focuses on the characteristic of smallholder milk producers in The Gambia. Data were collected from 90 smallholder farm households to characterise milk producers and evaluate the profitability and viability status of this activity. Based on current typology of farms and gross margin analyses at farm level, the study identified two resource-based types of smallholder farms. The current milk production system is surely viable. Constraints to increased productivity include lack of improved technology at farm level and weak institutional support. Despite the low viability status, it is shown that milk production generates reliable incomes, which could be a departure for most farmers to intensify farming systems, particularly in areas where no loan schemes exist for purchasing agricultural inputs.

	abstract = {Although much research has shown otherwise, chimpanzees are still often classed as rainforest-dwellers. Most long-term studies of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are not situated in evergreen, closed-canopy equatorial forests, but instead are conducted in more open habitats. This study aims to elucidate the extent of chimpanzee ecological diversity by scrutinizing (recently) sympatric mammalian fauna at established study sites. We compiled presence or absence data on large mammal species at eight sites: Assirik, Bossou, Budongo, Gombe, Kibale, Lope, Mahale, and Tai. The sites were rank ordered on the most basic ecological variable: annual total rainfall. Only three of the 65 mammalian genera compiled were sympatric with chimpanzees at all sites: Potamochoerus (bushpig), Syncerus (buffalo), and Panthera pardus (leopard). Some subfamilies (e.g. colobines) were present at most sites, but some families (e.g. hyenids) were absent at most sites. Some taxa (e.g. suids, cercopithecines) correlated better than others (e.g. canids) with basic ecological variables. The most extreme chimpanzee study site for which data are available is Assirik, Senegal. Nowhere else are chimpanzees sympatric with Erythrocebus, Alcelaphus, Hippotragus, and Ourebia. As chimpanzees are often behavioral models for extinct hominins, these living faunal assemblages have implications for paleo-ecological reconstructions of ancestral habitats.},

	abstract = {Trypanosomosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in working equids in The Gambia. Recently, a progressive, severe neurological syndrome characterised by a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis has been identified and associated with Trypanosoma brucei infection of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of cerebral trypanosomosis is unclear and the clinical syndrome not well described. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to identify host and parasite related risk factors associated with the development of cerebral trypanosomosis and to describe the neurological syndrome associated with cerebral trypanosomosis. History, signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected from 326 horses and donkeys presented to The Gambia Horse and Donkey Trust. Neurological derangements in affected animals were described. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei was performed. The associations between signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters and PCR results were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was 50 \%, with infections dominated by T. congolense (44.1 \%) and a lower intensity of T. brucei (7.4 \%) and T. vivax (6.5 \%). Overall, 54.8 \% of neurological cases were PCR positive for trypanosomosis. Within the neurological sub-population prevalence remained similar to the whole population for T. congolense (48.4 \%) and T. vivax (6.5 \%); whilst the prevalence increased markedly for T. brucei (32.3 \%). Co-infections were identified in 32.3 \% of neurological cases. Donkeys typically presented with progressive cerebral dysfunction and cranial nerve deficits, whereas in horses a progressive spinal ataxia was predominant. Mortality in affected animals was high (82.4 \%). The final multivariable model identified a significant association between body condition score {\textless}=2 (OR 11.4; 95 \% CI 4.6-27.9; P = {\textless}0.001), and T. congolense and T. brucei. coinfection (OR 20.6; 95 \% CI 1.71-244.1; P = 0.016) with the presence of neurological deficits. This study has provided clinically relevant information confirming the link between T. brucei and neurological disease outbreak in the equid population of The Gambia, and crucially identified co-infection with T. brucei and T. congolense as a major risk factor for the development of neurological trypanosomosis. Further research is required to identify the epidemiology of co-infection in equidae of The Gambia, so that cerebral trypanosomosis can be better prevented in this vulnerable population.

	abstract = {Describing patterns and testing hypotheses on processes driving biological invasions represent major issues in ecology. Addressing these questions requires building adequate data sets, i.e., covering areas and spanning periods adapted to the invasion processes studied. Rodents include major invasive species, among which the black rat Rattus rattus and the domestic mouse Mus musculus have nearly colonized the entire world, from their native Asian range. To do so, they have benefitted from their ability to cope with human-modified environments and to live in the immediate vicinity of Man, who served as a vector of their dispersal between regions and continents. In Senegal, both R. rattus and M. musculus, initially introduced by early West European colonizers some centuries ago, are currently expanding thanks to road traffic and infrastructure development and rampant urbanization that concerns even remote regions of the country. As part of projects aimed at studying (1) the role of invasive black rat populations in the emergence of zoonotic diseases in southeastern Senegal, and (2) the evolutionary consequences of parasites in R. rattus and M. musculus invasions in Senegal, we conducted a series of field campaigns throughout the southern half of the country, between May 2012 and September 2015. The objectives were to catch commensal small mammals using standard trapping procedures, identify them using morphological or molecular tools, and take samples from them upon autopsy, to look for zoonotic parasites and pathogens. Along with data on individual specimens, information on microhabitats was gathered at each trap position. This resulted in the constitution of a data set of more than 13,000 trapnights, which allowed the capture of more than 3,100 small mammals, all characterized by a series of associated biological, geographical, and environmental data. The small mammals concerned are mainly rodents (10 species), shrews, and hedgehogs. The two invasive rodent species were the most numerous, exceeding in numbers all the other species pooled. This data set makes it possible to study coarse to fine-scaled distribution of species of this commensal community in southern Senegal, as well as the possible determinants of this distribution in terms of habitat preferences and/or interspecific interactions.

Little is known about the extent of variation in prevalence where obvious factors that may drive prevalence (e. g., human contact) are absent, so it is difficult to interpret variation when these factors are present. To address this issue, we studied troops of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) that had almost no contact with humans or domesticated species of plants or animals. We tested the null hypotheses that community composition, richness, and prevalence would be similar between groups in two comparisons: (1) between troops in the same locality with no known differences in drivers of prevalence, and (2) between samples at the same location taken more than 20 years apart. We collected anonymous fecal samples from two troops of baboons living in a wilderness site, Mt. Assirik, in the Niokolo-Koba National Park, Republic of Senegal, West Africa. We collected samples from two valleys and analyzed prevalence and richness with respect to place and time. Both prevalence and richness were similar in the two valleys, but significant changes emerged in both prevalence and community composition compared with the previous survey in 1978-1979. We also found that the nematode Enterobius and a fluke, Watsonius, co-occurred within hosts more frequently than expected. This phenomenon has not been previously noted in the literature, and it suggests common environmental drivers or facilitation among these parasites.},

Equines were recruited from the Central River District of The Gambia based on a clinical inclusion criteria ({\textgreater}=2 of PCV {\textless}=25\%, BCS {\textless}=1.5/5, oedema, temperature {\textgreater}=38.6degreeC, abortion, neurological signs). Included animals were treated for trypanosomiasis (isometamidium 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and microchipped. CSF was taken if neurological signs were evident. LAMP was performed on jugular blood samples in a field laboratory, PCR was performed with T. brucei spp. specific primers (Masiga et al., 1992). The study population consisted of 180/288 (63\%) of examined equines (54 horses and 126 donkeys) with a median age of 5.5 years (range 0.25-25). Combining PCR and LAMP results 24/180 (13\%) animals were T. brucei spp positive (7/24 were on both tests, 14/24 LAMP only and 3/24 PCR only). Six animals (3\%) had neurological signs, of these 3/6 were positive, (1/6 both tests, 1/6 LAMP, 1/6 PCR). For CSF samples, 4/4 (100\%) were positive on both tests. Prevalence of infection was comparable with previous studies (Pinchbeck et al., 2008). LAMP identified parasitaemia in more animals. In cases with advanced neuro-trypanosomiasis there was complete agreement on CSF samples. LAMP was practical for field use.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Infection of equids with Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) ssp. is of socioeconomic importance across sub-Saharan Africa as the disease often progresses to cause fatal meningoencephalitis. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed as a cost-effective molecular diagnostic test and is potentially applicable for use in field-based laboratories., PART I: Threshold levels for T. brucei ssp. detection by LAMP were determined using whole equine blood specimens spiked with known concentrations of parasites. Results were compared to OIE antemortem gold standard of T. brucei-PCR (TBR-PCR)., RESULTS I: Threshold for detection of T. brucei ssp. on extracted DNA from whole blood was 1 parasite/ml blood for LAMP and TBR-PCR, and there was excellent agreement (14/15) between tests at high (1 x 103/ml) concentrations of parasites. Detection threshold was 100 parasites/ml using LAMP on whole blood (LWB). Threshold for LWB improved to 10 parasites/ml with detergent included. Performance was excellent for LAMP at high (1 x 103/ml) concentrations of parasites (15/15, 100\%) but was variable at lower concentrations. Agreement between tests was weak to moderate, with the highest for TBR-PCR and LAMP on DNA extracted from whole blood (Cohen's kappa 0.95, 95\% CI 0.64-1.00)., PART II: A prospective cross-sectional study of working equids meeting clinical criteria for trypanosomiasis was undertaken in The Gambia. LAMP was evaluated against subsequent TBR-PCR., RESULTS II: Whole blood samples from 321 equids in The Gambia were processed under field conditions. There was weak agreement between LWB and TBR-PCR (Cohen's kappa 0.34, 95\% CI 0.19-0.49) but excellent agreement when testing CSF (100\% agreement on 6 samples)., CONCLUSIONS: Findings support that LAMP is comparable to PCR when used on CSF samples in the field, an important tool for clinical decision making. Results suggest repeatability is low in animals with low parasitaemia. Negative samples should be interpreted in the context of clinical presentation.},

	abstract = {In Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP), in the South East of Senegal, we studied the current spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) population size, density and distribution and assessed human-large carnivores' conflicts. We implemented 26 calling stations operations, installed 87 camera traps and obtained data from tourists, local guides and rangers. In addition, a questionnaire survey was carried out in 31 villages around the park. Our results showed an estimated density from 1.77 to 3.53 spotted hyenas/100 km(2) depending on used response rates (50-100\%) with a minimum population size between 144 and 288 individuals. According to the query survey, the spotted hyena is responsible for the majority of livestock predation around the park (87\% of all attacks on livestock), followed by African wild dog (6\%), lion (4\%) and leopard (3\%). A total of 63.1\% of all attacks were on cattle, while sheep and goats represent the remaining 36.9\%. Spotted hyena and lion mainly predated on livestock at night (93.5\% and 71.4\% of all attacks, respectively) in contrast to predation by African wild dog and leopard, for which the majority of the attacks occurred during the day (63.9\% and 62.5\%, respectively). Furthermore, there was more livestock killed during the wet season (58\% of all attacks) than during the dry season (42\% of all attacks). The distribution of conflicts across five sectors surrounding the park illustrate that the West sector is most impacted (49\% of all attacks; districts of Linkering and Medina Gounass) followed by the North West (32\%; districts of Dialocoto and Missira). Insights into the severity and dynamics of human-wildlife conflict will contribute towards finding effective mitigation measures, minimising loss of livestock and reducing conflicts.},

Crosses between animals from these two origins, as well as ''backcrosses'' and crosses between ''hybrids'' were all fertile, the latter having produced the largest litters on average.

Nevertheless, livestock farming operates far below the optimum production potential, mainly due to demographical, biophysical, economic, environmental, and sociopolitical challenges. To address these issues, we conducted this review with an overall objective of characterizing different livestock farming systems and to identify challenges and opportunities to improve livestock production in West Africa through the broader perspectives from the case of Senegal. Pastoral, agropastoral, and off-land systems are the three major livestock production systems in this region, which are unique in terms of agroclimatology and degree of intensification and integration. The major challenges identified in livestock farming systems are lack of pasture and quality feed, scarcity of water resources, climate change, undeveloped breeding and management of livestock, poor marketing and trade, and socioeconomic constraints. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on crop-livestock farming in Senegal and West Africa by proposing plausible interventions to improve the productivity of the farming system to improve food and nutritional security. Concentrated efforts must be taken in co-designing effective management interventions for sustainable intensification of livestock sector in the region, considering site-specific approaches.},

In 2012, 20 rats were caught, and their fleas were identified. DNA was extracted from 170 selected fleas and qPCR was carried out to detect Bartonella spp. Subsequently, a Bartonella culture was performed from the rat blood samples and the isolated strains (16S rRNA, rpoB, ftsZ and ITS3) were genotyped. A total of 1117 fleas were collected from 19 rats and identified as Xenopsylla cheopis, the tropical rat flea. Bartonella DNA was detected in 148 of 170 selected fleas (87.1\%). In addition, Bartonella strains were isolated from the blood of 17 rats (85\%). According to Bartonella gene-sequence-based criteria for species definition, the isolated strains were identified as B. massiliensis (four strains) and two potential new species related to the zoonotic B. elizabethae. In this paper, these potentially new species are provisionally called Candidatus Bartonella militaris (11 strains) and Candidatus Bartonella affinis (two strains) until their description has been completed. Cricetomys gambianus and its fleas could constitute a public health risk in Dakar due to the high prevalence of Bartonella infection reported.},

Content and statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the motivations of breeders and the factors influencing their participation in the breeding program. Results more particularly highlight the complexity of social issues within a breeding project, in face of classical determinants of adoption that are distance or production systems features. It pinpoints crucial levers of improvement, i.e., the management of animal property rights between the nucleus management and the participating breeders, the legitimacy of participants' representatives in cooperatives, and the strategic mobilization of member social networks. Also, adding on previous works of the authors, this study highlights the need to take better account of the dynamics of production systems, then paying sufficient attention to the objectives, preferences, and ongoing strategies of the breeders for the future.

We here test the hypothesis that M. musculus could be part of the diet of C. olivieri in a number of localities of Senegal where the two species are known to coexist. We use a metabarcoding approach based on the high-throughput sequencing of a 133 bp fragment of the COI gene, on DNA extracted from digestive tracts and faeces of a sample of 108 shrews. Beside insects of various groups (ants, beetles and cockroaches especially) representing usual items of shrew's diet, and traces of domestic mammals and poultry that were probably scavenged, several species of rodents were evidenced. Among them, M. musculus was by far the best represented species, found in 17 of the 54 shrews where at least one prey taxon was identified. This finding tends to confirm the potential role of C. olivieri as predator of house mice, while highlighting the capacity of this species to adapt its diet to environmental conditions.},

We compared parasite communities in sympatric P. troglodytes and Papio papio living in a wilderness site, in the Republic of Senegal, West Africa. We asked whether, in the absence of humans, there are significant differences between these hosts in their interactions with gastrointestinal parasites. We tested whether host, location, or time of collection accounted for variation in prevalence, richness and community composition, and compared prevalence across six studies. We concluded that, despite being closely related, there are significant differences between these two hosts with respect to their parasite communities. At our study site, prevalence of Balantidium, Trichuris and Watsonius was higher in P. papio. Papio papio harboured more parasites per host, and we found evidence of a positive association between Trichuris and Balantidium in P. troglodytes but not P. papio.},

However, what determines the successful establishment and spread of introduced populations remains unclear. Here, we explore several hypotheses linking invasion success and immune phenotype traits, including those based on the evolution of increased competitive ability concept. We compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). Transcriptome analyses identified differential expression between anciently and recently established populations for 364 mouse genes and 83 rat genes. All immune-related genes displaying differential expression along the mouse invasion route were overexpressed at three of the four recently invaded sites studied. Complement activation pathway genes were overrepresented among these genes. By contrast, no particular immunological process was found to be overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes of black rat. Changes in transcriptome profiles were thus observed along invasion routes, but with different specific patterns between the two invasive species. These changes may be driven by increases in infection risks at sites recently invaded by the house mouse, and by stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results constitute a first step toward the identification of immune eco-evolutionary processes potentially involved in the invasion success of these two rodent species.},

	abstract = {Jatropha curcas is a drought-resistant shrub belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. The kernel contains approximately 60 \% lipid in dry matter, and the meal obtained after oil extraction could be an exceptional source of protein for family poultry farming, in the absence of curcin and, especially, some diterpene derivatives phorbol esters that are partially lipophilic. The nutrient digestibility of J. curcas kernel meal (JKM), obtained after partial physicochemical deoiling was thus evaluated in broiler chickens. Twenty broiler chickens, 6 weeks old, were maintained in individual metabolic cages and divided into four groups of five animals, according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design where deoiled JKM was incorporated into grinded corn at 0, 4, 8, and 12 \% levels (diets 0, 4, 8, and 12 J), allowing measurement of nutrient digestibility by the differential method. The dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility of diets was affected to a low extent by JKM (85 and 86 \% in 0 J and 81 \% in 12 J, respectively) in such a way that DM and OM digestibility of JKM was estimated to be close to 50 \%. The ether extract (EE) digestibility of JKM remained high, at about 90 \%, while crude protein (CP) and crude fiber (CF) digestibility were largely impacted by JKM, with values closed to 40 \% at the highest levels of incorporation. J. curcas kernel presents various nutrient digestibilities but has adverse effects on CP and CF digestibility of the diet. The effects of an additional heat or biological treatment on JKM remain to be assessed.},

While this led to changes in the rhetoric of pastoral development, there have been no significant shifts in its conceptual foundations and working methods. This article analyses the forms of this persistence, its effects and its causes in the Valley of the Senegal River through a study of the introduction of a social business dairy project into the pastoral area surrounding the city of Richard Toll. The industrial dairy producers and the pastoralists mutually use each other for their own ends, thereby reinforcing the discrepancy between their objectives and the logic of their systems. The model of intensification is persistent because it plays a political role in constructing alliances between actors from agribusiness, and because choices about land use and resource access are depoliticised and repeatedly made in their favour. The article underlines the urgency of re-politicising and rethinking the logic behind pastoral development and the challenges it faces, and of deconstructing the rhetoric of reconciling profit with social development which serves mainly to reinforce the role that private businesses play in shaping public action.},

	abstract = {Among eight samples obtained from a French primatology research center, six adult guinea baboons (Papio hamadryas papio), caught in the wild in Senegal, had a peculiar human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV2)-like Western blot seroreactivity (p24(+), GD21(+), K55(+/-)). Partial sequence analyses of the tax genes (433 bp) indicated that these baboons were infected by a novel divergent simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV). Analyses of the complete proviral sequence (8,892 bp) for one of these strains (STLV-3/PPA-F3) indicate that this STLV was highly divergent from the HTLV-1 (61.6\% of nucleotide similarity), HTLV-2 (61.2\%), or STLV-2 (60.6\%) prototype. It was, however, much more closely related to the few other known STLV-3 strains, exhibiting 87 and 89\% of nucleotide similarity with STLV-3/PHA-PH969 (formerly PTLV-L/PH969) and STLV-3/CTO-604, respectively. The STLV-3/PPA-F3 sequence possesses the major HTLV or STLV open reading frames corresponding to the structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins. However, its long terminal repeat comprises only two 21-bp repeats. In all phylogenetic analyses, STLV-3/PPA-F3 clustered together in a highly supported single clade with the other known strains of STLV-3, indicating an independent evolution from primate T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) and PTLV-2. The finding of a new strain of STLV-3 in a West African monkey (Guinea baboon) greatly enlarges the geographical distribution and the host range of species infected by this PTLV type in the African continent. The recent discovery of several different STLV-3 strains in many different African monkey species, often in contact with humans, strongly suggests potential interspecies transmission events, as it was described for STLV-1, between nonhuman primates but also to humans.},

Bacteriological samples (swabs and aspirates) were obtained from various domestic animals living in different parts of the country. No B. pertussis nor B. parapertussis were isolated. However, for the first time to our knowledge, B. bronchiseptica was identified from small ruminants located in Africa. The positive animals were two goats and two sheep from Dakar slaughterhouse together with a goat living in a rural compound. The fact that it was identified in goats and sheep underlines the potential zoonotic of that bacterial species in countries where small ruminants are of economical and cultural relevance.},

	doi = {10.5253/arde.2022.a25},
	abstract = {Bird counts in the Ferlo, NW Senegal had shown that the density of groundforaging birds was much lower in grazed than in ungrazed savannah: 84\% fewer granivorous birds and 64\% fewer insectivorous birds. Between 1960 and 2010, in three areas within the same region, granivores declined by 39-97\% and insectivores by 61-91\%, losses attributable to the steadily increasing livestock grazing pressure. If these trends hold for all Sahelian rangelands, the extrapolation at the time indicated that 1.5 billion birds would have been lost in just half a century. The aim of this space-for-time substitution study was to investigate whether that extrapolation can be substantiated with data from the eastern Sahel. To permit analysis of the spatial and seasonal variation in grazing pressure and its impact on ground-foraging granivorous and insectivorous birds, we counted birds in 1901 sites across the entire region (Mauritania to Ethiopia) and took landscape photos of these sites to evaluate livestock presence. We also estimated livestock density from our counts of cowpats and of droppings of sheep and goats, and the cover of the soil vegetation. Within the same rainfall zone (200-400 mm/year), the grazing pressure was higher in the Ferlo than elsewhere in the Sahel. Grazing pressure declined in the Ferlo in the course of the dry season, indicating that cattle food supply became depleted. No such seasonal decline was recorded elsewhere in the Sahel. The same pattern was found for ground-foraging birds: a decline during the dry season in the Ferlo, but nowhere else in the same Sahel rainfall zone. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, when the grazing pressure was much lower than today, there were no records of a seasonal decline of ground-foraging birds in the Ferlo. The much lower densities of seed-eating birds in the Ferlo were not exhibited elsewhere in the Sahel, which is consistent with the phenomenon of local overgrazing. The previous extrapolated loss of 1.5 billion birds is therefore too high, because conditions in the Ferlo were found to differ from those experienced elsewhere in Sahel's arid zone. The actual overall loss cannot be specified due to lack of bird counts from the past in the eastern Sahel. The comparison of grazing pressure and bird densities across all rainfall zones of the western and eastern Sahel shows that increasing livestock densities negatively impact bird numbers. Livestock grazing pressure in the west was higher than in the east and most ground-foraging bird species were less common in the west than in the east. Furthermore, the majority of ground-foraging species in West Sahelian savannahs were exclusively confined to the arid and semi-arid zone, but in the east, these species were more widely distributed and also occupied the more humid zone to the south.},

We tested these hypotheses, by investigating ongoing house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus) invasions in Senegal (West Africa). We used a 16S gene rRNA amplicon sequencing approach to study potentially zoonotic bacterial communities in invasive and native rodents sampled along two well-defined independent invasion routes. We found that individual host factors (body mass and sex) were important drivers of these bacterial infections in rodents. We observed that the bacterial communities varied along invasion routes and differed between invasive and native rodents, with native rodents displaying higher overall bacterial diversity than invasive rodents. Differences in prevalence levels for some bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) provided support for ecological processes connecting parasitism and invasion success. Finally, our results indicated that rodent invasions may lead to the introduction of exotic bacterial genera and/or to changes in the prevalence of endemic ones.

Here, we examine the economic performance of smallholder dairy cattle enterprises in Senegal, using data from longitudinal monitoring of 113 households. The mean (and standard deviation) of the net returns (NR) per cow per annum (pcpa) was 21.7 (202.9) USD, whilst the NR per household herd per annum (phpa) was 106.1 (1740.3) USD. Only about half (52.2\%) of the dairy cattle enterprise had a positive NR. The most significant income components were milk sale followed by animal sale, whilst the most significant cost components were animal feed followed by animal purchase. When households were grouped by ranking on NRpcpa, an interesting trend was observed: whilst the mean NRpcpa showed a fairly linear increase from the lowest to highest NR groups, income and cost did not. Income and costs were both higher for the lowest and highest NR groups, in comparison to the intermediate NR groups. The mean NRs of households grouped by the main breed type they kept were not significantly different from each other, due to large variances within the breed groups. However, the mean total income and costs were significantly higher for households mainly keeping improved dairy breeds (Bos taurus or Zebu x Bos taurus crosses) in comparison to those keeping indigenous Zebu or Zebu by Guzerat crosses. This study highlights the highly variable (and often low) profitability of smallholder dairy cattle enterprise in Senegal. Further actions to address this are strongly recommended.},

Total annual tick burdens did not cause significant differences in LWG between acaricide-treated and control cattle in either breeds. LWG was also not affected during or after the annual peak of tick infestation (composed mainly by A. variegatum and R. senegalensis). Equally-high mortality (35\%), due to unidentified causes, was recorded in acaricide-treated and control Gobra cattle; mortality in N'Dama cattle was 7.5\%. In both breeds, about the 90\% of mortality occurred at the end of the dry season. Breed differences in tick burden confirm previous results.

	abstract = {The effects of a prophylactic anthelmintic intervention on the productivity of village based sheep and goats was studied in an area of high trypanosomosis risk in The Gambia during 2 and 3 years, respectively. In total, 223 sheep and 385 goats from five villages were included. Allocation to treatment groups (treated-control) was randomised by village, based on age and sex. Three treatments per rainy season were applied with Fenbendazole (Panacur, Hoechst, 2.5\%, 5 mg/kg). Mean nematode egg excretion per gram faeces (EPG) of the treated groups were significantly reduced by prophylactic anthelmintic treatment, indicating the efficiency of the treatment despite the risk of rapid reinfestation. Weight gain benefits of anthelmintic treatment were observed in all age categories ({\textgreater} 6 month) of sheep but not in goats. Kidding rates were significantly increased whilst the same positive trends were observed for other reproductive parameters (litter size, parturition interval) in both goats and sheep without reaching statistical significance. Birth weights of offspring born out of treated does and ewes were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) than those from the controls. In contrast, growth rates until 3 months of age were not influenced by the treatment status of the dam. Mortality rates until the age of 3 months of kids from treated does were significantly lower than of those from control does. Mean Packed Red Cell Volume (PCV) levels during the rains were significantly higher in treated goats than in control goats. The same trend was observed in sheep. In general, there were no interactions between trypanosome infections and effect of anthelmintic treatment, thus both factors acted independently. Finally, the live weight productivity index (12 months old-offspring in kg/year per dam) for treated dams was 24\% and 47\% higher than in control ewes and does, respectively. It can be concluded that, despite the continuous risk of trypanosome infections which has a negative impact on their productivity, a beneficial effect of anthelmintic treatment was observed in both species but most obviously in goats, measured as an increased production and improved health status. A cost-benefit analysis should be carried out in order to confirm whether prophylactic anthelmintic treatment can be recommended to farmers to increase their income from small ruminant production. Nevertheless, anthelmintic treatment will certainly optimise the trypanotolerance in these breeds.},

Blood examination showed Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax to be prevalent, while strongylid-type eggs were those most frequently encountered in faecal samples. A distinct seasonal fluctuation was detected for both blood levels of trypanosomes and helminth egg output. Strongylid burden and trypanosome infection had significant negative effects on packed red cell volume levels and body weights mainly in animals of 2-3 years old. Clear indications of an increased susceptibility to trypanosomosis were found in animals affected by helminths. Similarly, animals infected with trypanosomes were more frequently infested with strongyles and egg counts were higher than in cattle in which no trypanosomes were detected.},

During the expected peak of tick abundance, acaricide was applied fortnightly on the whole body in animals in Group S and only on the most infested body areas in cattle in Group S/S. Weight changes and skin lesions, directly associated with tick attachment, were recorded in cattle in the three groups. The costs of the two tick control schemes were estimated. Maximum level of ticks, all species together, feeding on cattle was observed in the rainy season. Both in Group S/S and Group S, cattle carried a lower (P {\textless} 0.001) number of feeding ticks than animals in Group U over the whole study period. Percentage of tick control, over the entire period of tick investigation, was satisfactory in both acaricide-treated groups, reaching 61.2 and 75.2\% in Groups S/S and S, respectively. However, the proportion of control varied according to tick species or genus. Significantly lower prevalence of skin lesions was observed on the ano-genital and udder region in cattle in Group S/S (P {\textless} 0.05) and Group S (P {\textless} 0.01) in comparison with cattle in Group U. Mean amount of acaricide solution used and relative estimated cost of treatment in cattle in Group S/S were, respectively, 25- and 14-fold lower than those in cattle in Group S. At the end of the study, animals in Groups S/S and S were, respectively, 7.2 and 15.9 kg heavier than animals in Group U. The difference was statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.02) only between Groups S and U.

	abstract = {Wesselsbron disease is a neglected mosquito transmitted Flavivirus infection that causes abortions and has teratogenic effects on sheep and cattle in Africa. Human can also be infected. The detection of human or animal cases is complicated by the non-specific symptoms close to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in domestic livestock species or Dengue like syndrome in humans. Then, these detections are usually made during RVF investigations in sheep. These domestic animals should take a role in the life cycle of the virus but some evidences of Wesselsbron virus (WSLV) presence in wild animals suggest that the latter may be involved in the virus maintenance in nature. However, the reservoir status of wild vertebrate in general and rodents particularly for WSLV is only based on an isolation from a Cape short-eared gerbil in southern Africa. Most of WSLV isolations are from southern parts of Africa even if it has been found in western and central Africa or Madagascar. In Senegal, there are serological evidences of WSLV circulation in human since the 1970s and some isolations, the last one of which dates back in 1992. Despite the detection of the virus on mosquitoes until the 2000s in different parts of the country, no new human case has been noted. In this paper, we report the WSLV re-emergence in eastern Senegal in 2013 with 2 human cases and its first isolation from a black rat Rattus rattus. Sequencing analyses show the circulation of the same strain between these humans and the commensal rodent. The putative impact on WSLV transmission to human populations could be more important if the reservoir status of the black rat is confirmed. Focused survey in human populations, specific entomological and mammalogical investigations would permit a better understanding of the life cycle of the virus and its impact on public health.Copyright © 2017},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the drivers of the temporal dynamics of livestock mobility networks is currently limited, despite their significant implications for the surveillance and control of infectious diseases. We analyzed the effect of time-varying environmental and economic variables-biomass production, rainfall, livestock market prices, and religious calendar on long-distance movements of cattle and small ruminant herds in Senegal in the years 2014 and 2019. We used principal component analysis to explore the variation of the hypothesized explanatory variables in space and time and a generalized additive modelling approach to assess the effect of those variables on the likelihood of herd movement between pairs of administrative units. Contrary to environmental variables, the patterns of variation of market prices show significant differences across locations. The explanatory variables at origin had the highest contribution to the model deviance reduction. Biomass production and rainfall were found to affect the likelihood of herd movement for both species on at least 1 year. Market price at origin had a strong and consistent effect on the departure of small ruminant herds. Our study shows the potential benefits of regular monitoring of market prices for future efforts at forecasting livestock movements and associated sanitary risks. Copyright © 2023.

T. pallidum emerged as a highly infectious venereal syphilis agent in South America, probably about 500 years ago, and because of its venereal transmission, it quickly caused a worldwide pandemic. The disease manifests as lesions, including a chancre; then antibodies become detectable when or slightly after the chancre appears, and before the development of a rash and other systemic manifestations. Venereal diseases are poorly known in monkeys. During fieldwork in Senegal, we discovered an epizootic outbreak of venereal disease that we explored. We detected a venereal form of T. pallidum subsp. pertenue infection in green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus), then observed an epizootic outbreak in Senegal and its spread among baboons a year later. Comparative analysis of T. pallidum genomes from the monkeys' chancres and other Treponema genomes showed an acceleration of the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, comparable to that observed in syphilis. Identified T. pallidum clones seem to be epizootic through the acceleration of their mutation rate, which is linked to their larger diffusion. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to provide epidemiological information of equine trypanosomosis in the Central River Division (CRD) of The Gambia. Therefore, 2285 consultations records of equines, admitted in a gate-clinic at Sololo in CRD, were studied retrospectively. The data were recorded in the period between September 1995 and July 2002 and comprised consultations of 2113 horses and 172 donkeys. 'Trypanosome infection' was the most frequently diagnosed condition and accounted for 61\% of the cases. Horses were more frequently diagnosed with trypanosome infections than donkeys (p{\textless}0.001), with an occurrence of 63\% compared to 43\% in donkeys. In both horses and donkeys, trypanosome infections were mainly due to Trypanosoma congolense (64\%) and T. vivax (32\%). There was no difference observed in the occurrence of trypanosome infections in male or female donkeys (p=0.585), but there were more female (67.8\%) horses observed with trypanosome infections than male horses (60.7\%; p=0.003). There was no difference observed in the occurrence of trypanosome infections in donkeys older or younger than 1 year (p=0.130), but more older horses (63.2\% {\textgreater}1 year) were observed with trypanosome infections than young horses (54.5\% {\textless}1 year; p=0.033). The number of donkeys and horses with trypanosome infections decreased during the rainy season (June-September). The majority of equines that were admitted with trypanosome infections were severely anaemic. The average packed cell volume (PCV) declined with increasing parasitaemia (p=0.006). Seventy-four percent of the farmers' predictions of trypanosome infections in their equines were confirmed by darkground-microscopy. That proved that farmers had a fairly accurate knowledge of the diseases affecting their equines. The treatments executed at the gate-clinic were generally effective. The few (0.4\%) relapses of the T. vivax infections that were previously treated with diminazene aceturate in this study were not sufficient to prove drug resistance. The study showed that the analysis of consultation records at a gate-clinic can provide complementary information to conventional epidemiological studies in the same research area.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a disease that poses major threats to human and animal health, as well as the economy, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Whilst many studies have evaluated the economic impact of schistosomiasis in humans, to date only one has been performed in livestock in SSA and none in Senegal. This study aimed to estimate the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis in selected regions of Senegal., METHODS: Stochastic partial budget models were developed for traditional ruminant farmers in 12 villages in northern Senegal. The models were parameterised using data from a cross-sectional survey, focus group discussions, scientific literature and available statistics. Two scenarios were defined: scenario 1 modelled a situation in which farmers tested and treated their livestock for schistosomiasis, whilst scenario 2 modelled a situation in which there were no tests or treatment. The model was run with 10,000 iterations for 1 year; results were expressed in West African CFA francs (XOF; 1 XOF was equivalent to 0.0014 GBP at the time of analysis). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertain variables on the disease costs., RESULTS: Farmers surveyed were aware of schistosomiasis in their ruminant livestock and reported hollowing around the eyes, diarrhoea and weight loss as the most common clinical signs in all species. For scenario 1, the median disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 13,408 XOF, 27,227 XOF and 27,694 XOF, respectively. For scenario 2, the disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 49,296 XOF, 70,072 XOF and 70,281 XOF, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis on traditional subsistence and transhumance farmers is substantial. Consequently, treating livestock schistosomiasis has the potential to generate considerable benefits to farmers and their families. Given the dearth of data in this region, our study serves as a foundation for further in-depth studies to provide estimates of disease impact and as a baseline for future economic analyses. This will also enable One Health economic studies where the burden on both humans and animals is estimated and included in cross-sectoral cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of disease control strategies.

However, data on these livestock systems is lacking for their accurate evaluation. To provide guidance for climate change mitigation strategies in Senegal, it is necessary to obtain reliable estimates of CH4 emissions from Ndama cattle reared in grazing systems, which is the predominant cattle system in the country. The objective of this study was to determine the annual methane emission factor (MEF) for enteric fermentation of Ndama cattle following the IPCC Tier 2 procedure. Our estimated annual MEF at the herd scale was 30.8 kg CH4/TLU (30.7 kg CH4/head/yr for lactating cows and 15.1 kg CH4/head/yr for other cattle). These values are well below the default IPCC emission factor (46 and 31 kg CH4/head/yr for dairy and other cattle, respectively) proposed in the Tier 1 method for Africa. Our study showed that feed digestibility values differ with season (from 46 to 64\%). We also showed that cattle lose weight and adapt to lower feed requirements during the long dry season, with a resulting major reduction in methane emissions. The results of this work provide a new framework to re-estimate the contribution of grazing systems to methane emissions in Africa.},

	abstract = {Demographic parameters are useful for assessing productivity and dynamics of tropical livestock populations. Common parameters are the annual instantaneous hazard rates, which can be estimated by m/T (where m represents the number of the considered demographic events occurred during the year and T the cumulated animal-time at risk). Different approaches are encountered in the literature for computing T from on-farm survey data. One crude approach ("the 12-month interval approach") only uses estimations of herds' sizes at beginning and end of the year and aggregated counts of demographic events over the year. I evaluated the potential biases in using four 12-month interval methods (M1-M4) to estimate T. Biases were evaluated by comparing the 12-month estimates to gold-standard values of T. Data came from long-term herd monitoring on cattle and small ruminants in extensive agro-pastoral systems. Animal-times at risks were correctly estimated in average by methods M1, M2 and M4 (average relative biases{\textless}or=6\% in absolute values), except for adult-male small ruminants. For young animals, M2 and M4 showed equivalent biases. M2 is simple to implement and has the advantage of being applicable for any age-group, although M4 is only applicable for young animals. M3 was highly biased and I do not recommend it. Although accurate in average, 12-month interval methods showed highly variable biases. This variability results from interactions between the dates delimiting the 12-month interval and the distributions of the demographic events over time. This phenomenon is particularly important for the adult-male small ruminants. Based on the bias variability observed in the study, the user of 12-month interval methods has to remember that they only provide approximate results and that they cannot completely replace the gold-standard approaches.},

	abstract = {Many parameters have been proposed for evaluating livestock reproduction performances in tropical farming systems. In tropical free-ranged and small-holder systems, where reproduction cycles cannot be individually observed without expensive field surveys, one of these parameters is the average number of parturitions (h) expected by reproductive female, if the female spends the whole year in the herd. A frequent approach for estimating h is to use the ratio h(c) = m/T so-called 'crude annual parturition rate, where m is the observed number of parturitions and T is the total time of presence of the reproductive females in the herd during the year The bias encountered when h is estimated by hc was evaluated in this paper Six methods of estimation were used, where T was the exact observed time of presence (h(c1)) or approximated by monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly averages or final size of the reproductive herd size (h(c2) to h(c6)). Data came from long-term follow-up of cattle and small-ruminant herds (with data recorded at animal level) in extensive agro-pastoral systems in Senegal, In general h was correctly estimated by h(c1). Nevertheless h(c1) was sensitive to competing risks (e.g. deaths, sales and slaughtering of reproductive females) and was seriously biased when intensive withdrawals of females occurred before or during the parturition peak. Reliability of crude rates progressively decreased from h(c2) to h(c6), corresponding to the degradation of information used for approximating I This decrease was much lower for cattle (for which all methods had acceptable reliability) than for small ruminants. Among the compared methods, the lower reliability was observed for hc6 that we do not recommend for small ruminants. Methods h(c5) and h(c6) are currently used in rapid cross-sectional retrospective surveys based on the recall of the farmers on the demographic events which occurred in the herd over the last past 12 months. The study has showed that such surveys and estimates h(c5) and h(c6) can generate seriously biased results. More globally, annual parturition rates can be highly variable depending on the 12-month periods considered Annual parturition rates estimated on short-term data, even with precise herd follow-up surveys, must be considered cautiously},

However, little is known about the responses of human's closest living relative, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), to similar environmental stressors. In southeastern Senegal, one of the hottest and driest habitats that chimpanzees (P. t. verus) live in today, apes rely on behavioral mechanisms of dealing with thermal stress. Chimpanzees' use of caves was based primarily on indirect evidence (feeding traces, feces, and hairs) gathered from one cave from January to December 2004, but data from observational records collected from May 2001 through March 2006 supplement these data. The hypothesis that chimpanzees' use of caves is a response to heat was tested by collecting data on temperatures within the largest cave and in different habitats used by chimpanzees, such as gallery forest and woodland. Results indicate that chimpanzees primarily use caves as shelters during the hottest times of year and that caves are consistently and significantly cooler than open habitats. Insight into the way that chimpanzees in Senegal cope with extreme temperatures may help us to better understand the behavior of early hominids in such an environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut parasites exert an important influence on the gut microbiome, with many studies focusing on the human gut microbiome. It has, however, undergone severe richness depletion. Hygienic lifestyle, antimicrobial treatments and altered gut homeostasis (e.g., chronic inflammation) reduce gut microbiome richness and also parasite prevalence; which may confound results. Studying species closely related to humans could help overcome this problem by providing insights into the ancestral relationship between humans, their gut microbiome and their gut parasites. Chimpanzees are a particularly promising model as they have similar gut microbiomes to humans and many parasites infect both species., AIMS: We study the interaction between gut microbiome and enteric parasites in chimpanzees. Investigating what novel insights a closely related species can reveal when compared to studies on humans., METHODS: Using eighty-seven faecal samples from wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Senegal, we combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for gut microbiome characterization with PCR detection of parasite taxa (Blastocystis sp., Strongyloides spp., Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., Plasmodium spp., Filariae and Trypanosomatidae). We test for differences in gut microbiota ecosystem traits and taxonomical composition between Blastocystis and Strongyloides bearing and non-bearing samples., RESULTS: For Blastocystis, twelve differentially abundant taxa (e.g., Methanobrevibacter), including Prevotella and Ruminococcus-Methanobrevibacter enterotype markers, replicate findings in humans. However, several richness indices are lower in Blastocystis carriers, contradicting human studies. This indicates Blastocystis, unlike Strongyloides, is associated to a "poor health" gut microbiome, as does the fact that Faecalibacterium, a bacterium with gut protective traits, is absent in Blastocystis-positive samples. Strongyloides was associated to Alloprevotella and five other taxonomic groups. Each parasite had its unique impact on the gut microbiota indicating parasite-specific niches. Our results suggest that studying the gut microbiomes of wild chimpanzees could help disentangle biological from artefactual associations between gut microbiomes and parasites.

	abstract = {Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a growing health problem in West Africa. In northern Senegal, the candidate vectors of this arbovirosis are Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans Meigen and Culex (Culex) poicilipes Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae). Domestic ruminants are the reservoirs of the virus. A study was undertaken during the 2002 rainy season to assess spatial and temporal variations in exposure to mosquito bites in sheep herds, and to evaluate the possible consequences on the risk of RVF transmission to sheep. Mosquitoes were collected with sheep-baited traps. The number of Ae. vexans females (the predominant species during the 2002 rainy season) trapped per trap-night was the dependent variable in statistical analyses. The trapping periods were divided into six series of two to five consecutive days, from July to November 2002. Three temporary ponds were selected according to their ecological features: depth, bank slope, size and vegetation cover. Traps were laid on the pond bank and in the nearest available compound, close to the sheep night pen. Data were analysed using mixed-effects Poisson models. The explanatory variables were the trapping period, the pond, and the capture site. The exposure to mosquito bites varied according to the pond type, suggesting that the risk of transmission was spatially heterogeneous. However, there was no obvious trend in transmission risk due to the effect of the distance from the compound to the pond. The period with the highest exposure was in October, i.e. when transhumant herds left the Ferlo to relocate to their dry-season settlement. It is thus hypothesized that transhumance, the seasonal movements of herds, plays a significant role in the dissemination of RVF virus in the region.},

In a second experiment cows were given a total of 90 kg sesame cake over the last six months of the dry season, at rates of 1 kg day-1 for the first or last three months, or 0.5 kg day-1 throughout. During this period the provision of supplements produced significant overall average increases exceeding 60\% in both milk offtake for human consumption and calf growth. Maternal liveweight losses were reduced by a mean of 30\%. Concomitant significant increases in postpartum resumption of reproductive activity (two- to three-fold) and reduced calf mortality also occurred, while evidence was obtained that the improved diet better enabled the animals to withstand the effects of trypanosome infections. It was demonstrated that the dry-season provision of oil seed residues to lactating N'Dama cows in this environment can be expected to produce an extra litre of milk offtake, 260 g calf growth, and 380 g maternal liveweight gain kg-1 crude protein supplied, in addition to the improvement in other productivity characteristics.

	abstract = {Objectives: We evaluated risk-sensitive foraging in adult male western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) occupying a savanna environment at Fongoli, Senegal. The aim of this study was to determine how the risks of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata). Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli. Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party composition. Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress. Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective, risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live in sympatry.},

	abstract = {In the contemporary context of zoonosis emergence and spread, invasive species are a major issue since they represent potential pathogen hosts. Even though many progresses have been done to understand and predict spatial patterns of invasive species, the challenge to identify the underlying determinants of their distribution remains a central question in invasion biology. This is particularly exacerbated in the case of commensal species that strictly depend on humankind for dispersal and perennial establishment of new populations. The distribution of these species is predicted to be influenced by dispersal opportunities and conditions acting on establishment and proliferation, such as environmental characteristics, including spatio-temporal components of the human societies. We propose to contribute to the understanding of the recent spread of a major invasive rodent species, the black rat (Rattus rattus), in the changing southeastern of Senegal. We address the factors that promote the dispersal and distribution of this invasive rodent from the perspective of human geography. We first describe characteristics of human settlements in terms of social and spatial organization of human societies (i.e. economic activities, commercial and agricultural networks, roads connectivity). We then explore the relationship between these characteristics and the distribution of this invasive rodent. Finally we propose that historical and contemporary dynamics of human societies have contributed to the risk of invasion of the black rat. We argue that the diffusion processes of invasive species cannot be considered as a result of the spatial structure only (i.e. connectivity and distance), but as a part of the human territory that includes the social and spatial organization. Results suggest that the distribution of invasive rodents partly results from the contemporary and inherited human socio-spatial systems, beyond the existence of suitable ecological conditions that are classically investigated by biologists.},

It is necessary to know the parasitological situation of the primates that are under surveillance in the park. Aim: To estimate the prevalence and diversity of gastrointestinal parasites, including zoonotic potential parasites, in baboons in the Niokolo-Koba National Park located in Senegal. Method: Fecal samples (n = 50) from two groups of baboons (A and B) were collected in October 2019. The samples were processed using the flotation technique and the modified Ritchie method. Slides were examined microscopically and the parasite identification was based on morphology, color, and parasite content. Results: A total of seven nematodes (Strongyloides sp., Trichirus sp., Ancylostoma sp., Mammo monogamus, Enterobius sp., Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyle digestif), one cestode (Bertiella sp.), and one trematode (Fasciolopsis sp.) were identified. The overall prevalence was 78\%, while the prevalence of poly-infected samples was 49\%. The parasite with zoonotic potential, S. stercoralis, was identified in group B samples. Trichuris sp., which is common and pathogenic to humans and primates, was present with prevalence of 52\% and of 32\% in groups A and B, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that baboons are infested with zoonotic parasites and this situation could expose people working in this park to infection.

A total of 52 adult tapeworms were collected from sheep and cattle. Although the tapeworms of the two hosts were morphologically very close, phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 and SSU rDNA gene sequences showed that they were divided into two clades corresponding each to a host. The maximum pairwise divergence between the clades were 12.1\% in cox1 and 2.9\% in SSU rDNA, indicating they are distinct species. The tapeworms collected from sheep were morphologically identified as Thysaniezia ovilla, a cosmopolitan species in domestic ruminants. Detailed morphological observations revealed a consistent difference between the tapeworms obtained from sheep and those from cattle. The latter were identified as Thysaniezia connochaeti.

	abstract = {Understanding genetic diversity of Ehrlichia ruminantium in host and vector populations is an important prerequisite to controlling heartwater by vaccination in traditional livestock systems in sub-Saharan Africa. We carried out a study in two phases: (i) evaluating the usefulness of the PCR-RFLP assay based on the map1 coding sequence of E. ruminantium as a discriminatory tool to characterise genetic diversity, (ii) applying the technique to field samples from Amblyomma variegatum ticks and small ruminants to characterise genotypic diversity of the organism in three main agroecological zones of The Gambia, Sudano-Guinean (SG), Western Sudano-Sahelian (WSS) and Eastern Sudano-Sahelian (ESS). Restriction fragment length polymorphisms were observed among different strains of E. ruminantium supporting the usefulness of the PCR-RFLP technique for studying genetic diversity of the organism. Restriction enzyme map1 profile analysis indicated the presence in The Gambia of multiple genotypes (at least 11) of E. ruminantium with sites in the WSS and SG zones showing comparatively high number of diverse genotypes. Profiles similar to the Kerr Seringe genotype (DQ333230) showed the highest distribution frequency, being present at sites in all three agroecological zones, thereby making the strain a suitable candidate for further characterisation in cross-protection studies. An additional three genotypes showed relatively high distribution frequency and were present in all three zones making them equally important for isolation and subsequent characterisation. The study demonstrated the occurrence of mixed infections with E. ruminantium genotypes in ruminants and ticks.},

Various breeding strategies have been implemented to enhance their productivity and have improved farmer livelihoods. This review describes cattle breeding experiences across West Africa, spanning the N'Dama breed in Mali, Senegal, and The Gambia to the breeds Azawak Zebu, Fulani Zebu, and taurine Baoule in Burkina Faso. The main objectives of most breeding programs have been to optimize meat and milk performance of taurine and Zebu cattle as well as trypanotolerance of taurine cattle. In some cases, "closed nucleus" schemes have proven limited and so have evolved into "open nucleus" schemes. Recent community-based breeding programs have shown promise. The major challenges of breeding programs remain defining realistic breeding objectives and securing the involvement of stakeholders. All the strategies reviewed here have been funded externally within development or research projects that are often too short to yield tangible genetic improvement, and whether they will continue beyond those projects is uncertain. This review highlights the need for continuing government support to ensure the sustainability of local cattle breeding programs.},

Here, we report genome sequence analysis of six nairoviruses: Thiafora virus (TFAV) that was isolated from a shrew in Senegal; Yogue (YOGV), Kasokero (KKOV), and Gossas (GOSV) viruses isolated from bats in Senegal and Uganda; Issyk-Kul virus (IKV) isolated from bats in Kyrgyzstan; and Keterah virus (KTRV) isolated from ticks infesting a bat in Malaysia. The S, M, and L genome segments of each virus were found to encode proteins corresponding to the nucleoprotein, polyglycoprotein, and polymerase protein of CCHFV. However, as observed in Leopards Hill virus (LPHV) and Erve virus (ERVV), polyglycoproteins encoded in the M segment lack sequences encoding the double-membrane-spanning CCHFV NSm protein. Amino acid sequence identities, complement-fixation tests, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses cluster into three groups comprising KKOV, YOGV, and LPHV from bats of the suborder Yingochiroptera; KTRV, IKV, and GOSV from bats of the suborder Yangochiroptera; and TFAV and ERVV from shrews (Soricomorpha: Soricidae).

	abstract = {Increasing contact between humans and non-human primates provides an opportunity for the transfer of potential pathogens or antimicrobial resistance between host species. We have investigated genomic diversity and antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from four species of non-human primates in the Gambia: Papio papio (n=22), Chlorocebus sabaeus (n=14), Piliocolobus badius (n=6) and Erythrocebus patas (n=1). We performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing on 101 isolates from 43 stools, followed by nanopore long-read sequencing on 11 isolates. We identified 43 sequence types (STs) by the Achtman scheme (ten of which are novel), spanning five of the eight known phylogroups of E. coli. The majority of simian isolates belong to phylogroup B2 - characterized by strains that cause human extraintestinal infections - and encode factors associated with extraintestinal disease. A subset of the B2 strains (ST73, ST681 and ST127) carry the pks genomic island, which encodes colibactin, a genotoxin associated with colorectal cancer. We found little antimicrobial resistance and only one example of multi-drug resistance among the simian isolates. Hierarchical clustering showed that simian isolates from ST442 and ST349 are closely related to isolates recovered from human clinical cases (differences in 50 and 7 alleles, respectively), suggesting recent exchange between the two host species. Conversely, simian isolates from ST73, ST681 and ST127 were distinct from human isolates, while five simian isolates belong to unique core-genome ST complexes - indicating novel diversity specific to the primate niche. Our results are of planetary health importance, considering the increasing contact between humans and wild non-human primates.},

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica is the most common foodborne pathogen worldwide. It causes two types of diseases, a self-limiting gastroenteritis and an invasive, more threatening, infection. Salmonella gastroenteritis is caused by several serotypes and is common worldwide. In contrast, invasive salmonellosis is rare in high-income countries (HIC) while frequent in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Invasive Nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS), corresponding to serotypes other than Typhi and Paratyphi, have emerged in sSA and pose a significant risk to public health. We conducted a wholegenome sequence (WGS) analysis of 72 strains of Salmonella isolated from diarrheic human patients and chicken meat sold in multipurpose markets in Dakar, Senegal. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing combined with WGS data analysis revealed frequent resistance to fluoroquinolones and the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination that are among the most used treatments for invasive Salmonella. In contrast, resistance to the historical firstline drugs chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and to cephalosporins was rare. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was lower in clinical isolates compared to chicken strains pointing to the concern posed by the excessive use of antimicrobials in farming. Phylogenetic analysis suggested possible transmission of the emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) Kentucky ST198 and serotype Schwarzengrund from chicken to human. These results stress the need for active surveillance of Salmonella and AMR in order to address invasive salmonellosis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella strains and other important bacterial diseases in sSA.Copyright © 2022 Dieye et al.

Habituation has invaluable strengths, particularly in quantity and diversity of data collected, but along with these come substantial weaknesses, i.e., costs both in time and effort, health risks, and potential exposure of subjects to poaching. With new technologies, we are able to extend our studies beyond the limitations of habituation; camera traps are one technology that can be used to study unhabituated primate groups. In this study we used eight camera traps over the course of 2 yr (1542 camera trap days) to capture thousands of still images of West African savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Fal,m, region of southeastern Senegal. Images corroborated behavioral observations from habituated chimpanzees at the Fongoli site, where researchers have observed nocturnal activity and cave use. The cameras also captured interspecies interactions at water sources during the dry season and allowed us to determine demographic composition and minimum community size. The photographs provide data on local fauna, including predators (Panthera pardus pardus, Panthera leo senegalesis, and Crocuta crocuta), potential prey, and competitor species (Papio papio, Cercopithecus aethiops, and Erythrocebus patas). As primate habitat across Africa is further threatened and human-wildlife conflict increases, camera trapping could be used as an essential conservation tool, expanding studies of primates without exacerbating potential threats to the species.},

	abstract = {The similarities of HIV2 with SIV raise thr question of natural interspecific transmission of retrovirus amongst Primates. This study tries to evaluate the possibilities of natural interspecific transmission Of SIV within a Green and a Patas monkey population of the Fathala forest (Saloum Delta National Park, Senegal). Methods include a description and a quantification of the interspecific relations between Green and Paras monkeys. Demographic structure and SIV seroepidemiology of the population are also studied. The tendency of Green monkeys to associate with Patas monkeys was measured using two methods : (I) measuring proportion of time spent in association with Paras Monkeys by one focus Green Monkeys troop; and (2) generalisation of the result by measuring proportion of troops containing Green monkeys associated with Paras Monkeys. Direct observation of interspecific interactions focused on contacts and exchange of biologic fluids. On the basis of 12 days uninterrupted observation, one focus troop of green monkeys spent a mean of 2 h 26 mn per day in association with Patas monkeys, which corresponds to 19 \% of their day time. On the basis of 114 independent troops encounters, 18 \% (57 \% of plurispecific troops) of the troops include mixed individuals of Green and Paras Monkeys. This value allows the extension of the result to the whole monkey population of the Fathala forest. All kinds of social behaviour, hedonic and agonistic, have been observed between Green and Paras monkeys. Retrovirus transmission risk behaviour included mucous membrane contact with biologic fluids: biting and genital grooming. One easily identified female Paras is known to have given birth to five infants from Green monkeys father(s), arguing for the existence of interspecific sexual relations. On the basis of preliminary results of one group of Green Monkeys intensive study, frequency of retrovirus transmission risk behaviour could be estimated at more than 50 per year. Sexual transmission of SIVagm, and transmission by biting, have previously been shown. Natural infection of yellow baboons and experimental infection of Patas Monkeys with Green Monkey SIVagm have also been reported. Data show that naturally occurring interspecific transmission of SIVagm from Green to Paras monkeys in the Wild must occur frequently.},

This resulted in an increasingly rapid decline in light intensity at dusk as the season progressed. Hens went to roost significantly later in the day, and at lower light levels, over the course of the season. The results support a model suggesting that the cue to start roosting is a certain light level, constant over the season, but the 'settling period' required means that the hens finally roost at later times and at lower light levels as the season progresses.

Solid knowledge of the hamadryas and savannah baboon systems has accumulated, leading to a dichotomic view of baboon social systems. Hamadryas baboons live in multilayered troops based on 1-male units whereas savannah baboons live in multimale multifemale groups based on a network of related females. Less attention has been paid to their West African congenerics, the Guinea baboons, Papio papio. To fill this gap, in 2007 we initiated a long-term study of a baboon troop ranging in the Niokolo Koba National Park in southeastern Senegal. Earlier studies suggested a tendency for a multilayered social system in Guinea baboons, similar to the hamadryas baboon organization. Therefore, as a first approach to analyzing variability in party size and composition, we observed members of the troop crossing an open area from a fixed point for 3 mo during the dry and wet seasons. We counted individuals and recorded changes in composition of both arriving and departing parties. Party size and composition were highly variable on both a daily and a seasonal basis; 45.9\% of the arriving parties changed in composition while crossing the open area, either splitting into smaller parties or fusing into larger ones, suggesting a fluid organization. Our data support the existence of neither a hamadryas baboon-like multilayered social organization nor a stable medium-sized multimale multifemale group as in savannah baboons. In light of our data we may need to revise the dichotomic view of baboon social systems and include space for greater variability of their social systems.},

	abstract = {Trypanosome infections, packed red cell volume levels (PCV), body weight and nematode faecal egg counts of village-based small ruminants were monitored in two areas in The Gambia with either moderate or high trypanosomosis risk for 24 and 30 months respectively. Outflows from the flock and new-born animals were recorded and data on housing and management were compiled. Reported mortality rates were higher in goats than in sheep, but for both species highest in the moderate risk area. The peak of trypanosome infections lagged the peak of tsetse densities by 1-3 months in both areas. Trypanosoma vivax was the predominant species found in the infected animals, followed by T. congolense. Trypanosome prevalence was, in general, higher in sheep than in goats but only significantly higher during Year 1 in the moderate risk area. Trypanosome infection reduced the PCV level significantly and seasonal effects indicated significantly lower PCV levels during the rains. Trypanosome infection significantly depressed weight gain in both species at periods where infection rates were highest. In both species considerably lower weight gains were observed during the rainy season. Abortion rates were higher in goats than in sheep in both study sites, and highest in the high-risk site. Trypanosome infection in ewes in the high risk area increased lamb mortality significantly but had no effect on birth weights, nor on growth rates up to 4 months. Offspring mortality up to 4 months was generally high at both sites. Trypanosome infection in the dam between 3.5 to 7 months post parturition significantly increased parturition interval in both species. Peak faecal egg output occurred at the end of the rainy season and was highest for both species in the moderate risk site. Poor grazing management was found responsible for a seasonal nutritional constraint. Based on these results, these breeds of sheep and goats can be considered as trypanotolerant since they are able to remain productive under high and moderate levels of trypanosome challenge. Nevertheless, trypanosomosis affected their health and production level as shown by reduced PCV levels, depressed weight gains, longer parturition intervals and higher lamb mortality. In addition, during the rains, helminth infections and poor management leading to nutritional constraints had also a negative impact on health and production and therefore influenced the innate resilience to trypanosomosis in those indigenous breeds. Adaptations in management may have an equal impact as certain disease control measures to improve biological and economical returns from small ruminants in tsetse infested rural areas.},

We asked (a) whether the host species have the same parasites; (b) whether there is any observable pattern relative to the host species/habitat type in the structure of parasite communities; (c) whether the variability in parasite community for each host species is related to habitat characteristics. We analysed 220 and 264 individuals of each host species, sampled respectively in 10 and 11 trap sites. Twenty parasite taxa were recorded, and the majority were nematodes. Between-host species comparisons showed that helminth communities were slightly more diversified in M. natalensis. Many parasite species were found in both Mastomys. However, various helminth taxa varied in frequency and abundance between host species. Within each host species, helminth diversity, prevalence and/or abundance of some parasites were correlated with habitat or host population factors that may influence parasite life-cycles, such as village structure, or the presence/absence of a pool.

	abstract = {The feeding behavior and fodder intake of cattle, sheep and goats grazing semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa rangelands in Senegal was studied over a one-year cycle. The objective of the study was to improve the assessment of fodder intake by livestock grazing rangelands in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, The study was conducted in the service area of a borehole that includes 354 pastoral settlements and a total of 11,000 cattle and 1800 small ruminants. The grazing behavior of five steers was monitored monthly. Their forage intake was estimated every month from hand plucking simulations of all the bites of forage taken by the steers 24 h out of 48. The feces they excreted during the day were collected in fecal bags. Near infrared spectrum (NIRS) images were used to analyze 80 samples of these feces, and the data were then added to an existing reference data set to predict fodder intake and digestibility using NIBS. The complete and contextualized data base was then used to predict the daily fodder intake and its digestibility by cattle, sheep and goats whose fresh feces were systematically and randomly sampled every month in the study area (768 samples). Annual means of the daily dry matter fodder intake were 68.4 +/- 6.4 g/kg LW0.75 or 17.2 +/- 1.7 g/kg LW for cattle, 73.1 +/- 5.3 g/kg LW07.5 or 34.3 +/- 2.8 g/kg LW for sheep, and 74.7 +/- 8.7 g/kg LW0.75 or 37.1 +/- 4.4 g/kg LW for goats. The annual mean organic matter digestibility of grazed fodder was higher for goats (67.4 +/- 3.9\%) than for sheep (64.1 +/- 3.2\%) and cattle (59.3 +/- 3.8\%). The seasonal variations in diet digestibility were bigger for cattle than for sheep, and smaller for goats. The standard reference used to assess livestock fodder intake in tropical Africa relies on a fixed daily intake rate per unit live weight of 25 g/kg LW. Our results show that this method overestimates (+ 45\%) intake by cattle, especially in the dry season, and underestimates intake by small ruminants (-24\%). Alternative assessment methods are proposed either relying on a single standard annual intake per metabolic weight unit for all ruminant species, 73 g/kg LW0.75 per day, or on separate annual intake norms per live weight unit for cattle (18 g/kg LW per day) and small ruminants (34 g/kg LW per day). In both cases, modulations (+/- 12\%) of the norm are proposed for use in the wet and dry season.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Schistosoma parasitic worms, which inflicts a significant burden on human and animal populations, particularly across sub-Saharan Africa. Anthropogenic landuse changes affect the distribution and availability of suitable definitive and intermediate hosts, increasing opportunities for hybridization between human and animal schistosomes with subsequent zoonotic transmission. This can have a substantial impact on the dynamics and distribution of schistosomiasis, with further challenges and constraints for effective control. Our aim was to elucidate the role of different definitive hosts as reservoirs of zoonotic Schistosoma single species and hybrids in a region of northern Senegal subject to important anthropogenic change. Extensive and systematic parasite sampling from human, livestock, and rodent definitive hosts, combined with snail intermediate hosts, were performed over three years across key transmission sites in northern Senegal. Multi-locus molecular analyses of all Schistosoma isolates, followed by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI), were used to infer phylogenetic and transmission dynamics between the circulating zoonotic Schistosoma species/hybrids and their hosts. Molecular analyses confirmed the presence of widespread viable hybridization within and between Schistosoma species of humans and animals. Phylogenetic analyses indicated shared transmission of zoonotic Schistosoma species and hybrids between humans and animals (both wild and domestic), providing unique insights into the role of different host species in maintaining transmission. Our study emphasizes the need for a One Health multi-host framework for schistosomiasis control in both people and animals living in high zoonotic transmission zones of sub-Saharan Africa.},

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protective efficacies of inactivated and attenuated vaccines to protect sheep against heartwater in The Gambia. An inactivated vaccine, prepared from E. ruminantium (Gardel stock), and a live attenuated vaccine from E. ruminantium (Senegal stock), were evaluated in two independent on-station trials. A local stock of E. ruminantium (Kerr Seringe) was used as challenge material. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines provided 43\% and 100\% protection, respectively, against virulent needle challenge. In a subsequent field trial, the attenuated vaccine protected 75\% of sheep against virulent tick challenge, which was fatal for all control sheep. Quantification by real-time PCR showed that an immunising dose of approximately 23,000 attenuated E. ruminantium organisms was sufficient. Moreover, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated that the local Kerr Seringe genotype caused mortality amongst control sheep, whereas fatalities in the vaccinated group could be attributed to a different genotype. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

By Western blotting, sera from bovines (n=6), ovines (n=36), and caprines (n=36) did not react with Anopheles whole saliva. In contrast, equine sera recognized proteins in both saliva and salivary gland extracts. Two of the major immunogens (32 and 72 kDa) were also reactive in extracts from other major mosquito genera (Aedes and Culex), but reactions toAnopheles-specific antigens were detected in 12 of 17 horses.

Consecutive cross-sectional surveys conducted every 5 months among {\textasciitilde}15\% of participating households show that despite project-provided training and inputs, there was only limited uptake of many "best practices." Few households constructed improved henhouses; vaccination rates varied and were highest when support was provided. Poultry mortality was high. Egg productivity remained average for village poultry systems, and egg consumption remained low (two to six eggs consumed per household per fortnight). However, children whose mothers were exposed to project messages on nutrition were more likely to eat eggs, and consumption was consistently higher among households with chickens. Women's involvement in chicken rearing was widespread, but their control over revenues from the sale of poultry products was limited. Key lessons learned from implementation were as follows: (a) strong behaviour change communication is needed to encourage egg consumption, (b) nutrition-sensitive village poultry programmes should often focus more on improved practices than improved breeds, (c) supporting women's chicken production is not a route to empowerment without complementary activities that directly support women's ownership and decision making. There is also a need for rigorous research on the role of village poultry in livelihoods, food systems, and consumption as well as the structure of poultry and egg markets in low-resource areas.

Sufficient knowledge on its epidemiology, particularly on species and biotypes of Brucella at national and/or regional scale are important to set up and implement efficient control measures against brucellosis in a "One health" perspective. The main objective of this review was to investigate available literature on strains of Brucella in order to provide a state of art-knowledge on species and biovars reported in cattle from West Africa. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant data on species and biovars of Brucella in cattle from Western African countries. This search included studies presenting bacteriological and/or molecular results of identification and typing, relied on international classification methods with no time limit and no language restrictions. Studies reporting results of identification at genus level only were not considered for this review. This review revealed that Brucella abortus was the most prevalent species in cattle from West Africa, in line with host preference for Brucellae. So far, biovars 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and intermediate biovar 3/6 of B. abortus were reported in cattle in the region. Among these strains, biovars 3, recently identified in The Gambia and Ivory Coast, was the most commonly isolated. Brucella melitensis and/or B. suis have not been mentioned yet in cattle in this part of Africa. The public health significance of prevailing strains is discussed and a regional collaborative control program of brucellosis is suggested. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We conducted an active influenza surveillance in the single pig slaughterhouse in Dakar to investigate the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and to provide serologic evidence of avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in pigs at interfaces with human populations in Senegal. Nasal swab and blood samples were collected on a weekly basis from the same animal immediately after slaughter. Influenza A viruses were diagnosed using RT-qPCR and a subset of positive samples for H3 and H1 subtypes were selected for full genome amplification and NGS sequencing. Serum samples were tested by HI assay for the detection of antibodies recognizing four AIVs, including H9N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H5N2. Between September 2018 and December 2019, 1691 swine nasal swabs were collected and tested. Influenza A virus was detected in 30.7\% (520/1691), and A/H1N1pdm09 virus was the most commonly identified subtype with 38.07\% (198/520), followed by A/H1N2 (16.3\%) and A/H3N2 (5.2\%). Year-round influenza activity was noted in pigs, with the highest incidence between June and September. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the IAVs were closely related to human IAV strains belonging to A/H1N1pdm09 and seasonal H3N2 lineages. Genetic analysis revealed that Senegalese strains possessed several key amino acid changes, including D204 and N241D in the receptor binding site, S31N in the M2 gene and P560S in the PA protein. Serological analyses revealed that 83.5\% (95\%CI = 81.6-85.3) of the 1636 sera tested were positive for the presence of antibodies against either H9N2, H5N1, H7N7 or H5N2. Influenza H7N7 (54.3\%) and H9N2 (53.6\%) were the dominant avian subtypes detected in Senegalese pigs. Given the co-circulation of multiple subtypes of influenza viruses among Senegalese pigs, the potential exists for the emergence of new hybrid viruses of unpredictable zoonotic and pandemic potential in the future.},

Specifically, biodiversity assessments will better elucidate the chimpanzee extinction risk here and yield baselines for monitoring. We compared mammal species richness between Fongoli (unprotected) and Assirik in Niokolo-Koba National Park to assess the efficacy of the only nationally protected area where chimpanzees range in this country. The primary habitat difference between these sites was the degree of human activity. Although Assirik and Fongoli had similar mammal assemblages and were equivalent in primate species richness, the protected area was higher in species richness overall, particularly for ungulates and carnivores. The protected status and management plan of Niokolo-Koba almost certainly resulted in fewer mammal extinctions. In unprotected areas, the flexible behavioural responses of chimpanzees to human-driven landscape dynamics is likely essential to their long-term survival. Furthermore, the near absence of chimpanzee killings in this country greatly facilitates conservation efforts. Given that mineral extraction is a key development strategy in Senegal, we encourage primatologists to collaborate with mining stakeholders to ensure that sustainability programming includes contributions from experts in savannah chimpanzee behavior and ecology.

Despite the active circulation of the disease in the world, few studies have been carried out in Senegal. The objective of this study was to assess the current prevalence of BT in small ruminants and the serotypes circulating in Senegal. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the fourteen regions of Senegal. After the sampling campaign, sera collected in sheep and goats herds were screened for the presence of Bluetongue virus (BTV) specific antibodies using c-Elisa. The whole blood of seropositive animals was further analyzed by RT-qPCR and positive samples were typed to identify BTV serotypes. Analysis of several risk factors such as age, sex and species of animals was performed using logistic regression. The overall seroprevalence of BTV in Senegal was 72.6\% (95\% CI: 70.3-74.9\%) with 75.9\% (95\% CI: 72.2-79.5\%) in goat and 70.6\% (95\% CI: 67.5-73.6\%) in sheep. Female (prevalence=77.1\%) and adult (prevalence=80\%) animals showed the highest seropositivity to BTV compared respectively to male (55.7\%, p=6.133e-09) and young (49.4\%, p {\textless} 2.2e-16). The RT-qPCR results showed the presence of BT viral genome in 359 small ruminants. The results obtained from serological and genotyping studies showed an active spread of the Bluetongue virus in domestic ruminants and phylogenetic analysis showed that the BTV-2 is one of the circulating serotypes in Senegal. This study allows having baseline information for controlling Bluetongue in Senegal.},

Based on an integrated assessment framework, semi-structured questionnaires which were pre-tested and then administered in five regions were used. Relationships among the investigated variables were statistically explored with Pearson chi-square test and strength of association quantified with Phi or Cramer's V coefficient. Rough coat, eye and nose discharge, loss of appetite and weight were more consistently observed as signs of AAT in infected lactating cows. Older cows with more than three calving (75.8\%) were indicated as the most susceptible and there is no fixed number of times (85.2\%) a cow is treated for AAT in a year. The most commonly recognized effect (91.7\%) of AAT is milk reduction. Statistically significant positive but moderate relationship exist between milk reduction and late dry season (phi coefficient of 0.221), between milk contamination and early dry season (phi coefficient of 0.226), and also between wateriness and rainy season (phi coefficient of 0.220). Milk discolouration is not statistically related to any season with highest AAT infection rates. The need for integrated assessment of veterinary challenges based on factors such as herd affiliation status, ethnic affiliation, and farmers' objectives before preventive veterinary and production interventions are designed or implemented is implied.

In rodents, the genus Gerbillus characteristic of North African and Asian arid habitats has been affected by this climatic and environmental trends. Several species of this genus showed a southward range expansion in recent years into the Sahelian bioclimatic zone. Recent sampling in several localities of West Africa (Mali, Niger and Senegal) enabled us to collect numerous specimens of small gerbils. An integrative study of these samples using molecular, morphological and cytogenetical methods revealed that many of them were attributable to Gerbillus nancillus, a secretive and poorly known species. Gerbillus nancillus appears characterized by a well differentiated karyotype with 2n = 56 chromosomes, and to represent a unique genetic lineage within this genus. Body and skull measurements of G. nancillus were compared with those of the morphologically similar Gerbillus henleyi, which provided diagnostic clues between them. These new data significantly expand the distribution area of G. nancillus, which now ranges from Sudan in the East to Senegal in the West. G. nancillus is here reported from numerous new localities in Niger and Mali, and for the first time in Senegal, which raises questions about the origin of its presence and the colonization routes it followed to get there. We also show that G. henleyi and G. nancillus are sympatric and apparently often syntopic in the sub-Saharan part of the distribution of G. henleyi. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Schistosomes are dioecious parasitic flatworms, which live in the vasculature of their mammalian definitive hosts. They are the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a disease of considerable medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions. Schistosomes undergo a sexual reproductive stage within their mammalian host enabling interactions between different species, which may result in hybridization if the species involved are phylogenetically close. In Senegal, three closely related species in the Schistosoma haematobium group are endemic: S. haematobium, which causes urogenital schistosomiasis in humans, and S. bovis and S. curassoni, which cause intestinal schistosomiasis in cows, sheep and goats. Methodology/Principal Findings: Large-scale multi-loci molecular analysis of parasite samples collected from children and domestic livestock across Senegal revealed that interactions and hybridization were taking place between all three species. Evidence of hybridization between S. haematobium/S. curassoni and S. haematobium/S. bovis was commonly found in children from across Senegal, with 88\% of the children surveyed in areas of suspected species overlap excreting hybrid miracidia. No S. haematobium worms or hybrids thereof were found in ruminants, although S. bovis and S. curassoni hybrid worms were found in cows. Complementary experimental mixed species infections in laboratory rodents confirmed that males and females of each species readily pair and produce viable hybrid offspring. Conclusions/Significance: These data provide indisputable evidence for: the high occurrence of bidirectional hybridization between these Schistosoma species; the first conclusive evidence for the natural hybridisation between S. haematobium and S. curassoni; and demonstrate that the transmission of the different species and their hybrids appears focal. Hybridization between schistosomes has been known to influence the disease epidemiology and enhance phenotypic characteristics affecting transmission, morbidity and drug sensitivity. Therefore, understanding and monitoring such inter-species interactions will be essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies across such potential hybrid zones. © 2013 Webster et al.},

	abstract = {Humans' extensive use of fire is one behavior that sets us apart from all other animals. However, our ancestors' reliance on controlled forms of fire-i.e., for cooking-was likely preceded by a long familiarity with fire beginning with passive exploitation of naturally burned landscapes and followed by intermediate steps including active ecological modification via intentional burning. Here we explore our pyrophilic beginnings using observational data from savanna-dwelling chimpanzees. These data highlight the extent to which anthropogenic burning impacts the behavior and ecology of sympatric primates and provides an opportunity to study the ways in which apes living in a fire-altered world exploit opportunities presented by burning. Using monthly burn scar data and daily range use data we quantify the impact of burning episodes on chimpanzee habitat. Over the course of one dry season, approximately 74\% of the total estimated range of the Fongoli community of savanna-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) was impacted by fire. We combine fire occurrences with behavioral data to test for relationships between burning and rate of encounter with food items and duration of subsequent patch residence time. Results show more frequent encounters and shorter patch residence times in burned areas. These data can be leveraged as a frame of reference for conceptualizing our extinct relatives' behavior around fire.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Male-male social relationships in group-living mammals vary from fierce competition to the formation of opportunistic coalitions or the development of long-lasting bonds. We investigated male-male relationships in Guinea baboons (Papio papio), a species characterized by male-male tolerance and affiliation. Guinea baboons live in a multi-level society, with units of one reproductively active "primary" male, 1-6 females, and offspring at the core level. Together with "bachelor" males, several units form a party, and 2-3 parties constitute a gang. We aimed to clarify to which degree male relationship patterns varied with relatedness and pair-bond status, i.e., whether males had primary or bachelor status. Data were collected from 24 males in two parties of Guinea baboons near Simenti in the Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal. Males maintained differentiated and equitable affiliative relationships ("strong bonds") with other males that were stable over a 4-year period, irrespective of their pair-bond status. Remarkably, most bachelor males maintained strong bonds with multiple primary males, indicating that bachelor males play an important role in the cohesion of the parties. A clear male dominance hierarchy could not be established due to the high degree of uncertainty in individual rank scores, yet bachelor males were more likely to be found at the low end of the dominance hierarchy. Average relatedness was significantly higher between strongly bonded males, suggesting that kin biases contribute to the social preferences of males. Long-term data will be needed to test how male bonds affect male tenure and ultimately reproductive success. Significance statement Males living in social groups may employ different strategies to increase their reproductive success, from fierce fighting to opportunistic alliance formation or the development of long-term bonds. To shed light on the factors that shape male strategies, we investigated male-male social relationships in the multilevel society of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) where "primary" males are associated with a small number of females and their offspring in "units" while other males are "bachelors." Strong bonds occurred among and between primary and bachelor males and strongly bonded males were, on average, more closely related. Bachelor males typically had multiple bond partners and thus play an important role in the fabric of Guinea baboon societies. Across primate species, neither dispersal patterns nor social organization clearly map onto the presence of strong bonds in males, suggesting multiple routes to the evolution of male bonds.},

	abstract = {The large and widespread decline of European migratory birds spending the northern winter in the Sahel suggests - on top of adverse changes in the breeding quarters - pivotal changes in African overwintering areas. This paper attempts to answer three questions related to the sub-Saharan region: (1) can a change in the woody vegetation explain the decline of migratory birds feeding in trees, (2) ditto for the ground vegetation and bird species searching for food on the ground, and (3) are African bird species also in decline? The analysis is confined to the western Sahel (annual rainfall 100-400 mm, 15.5-18 degrees N and 14.7-16 degrees W), a region intensively used as rangeland but too dry for agriculture. The woody cover, largely stable before 1970, declined in the driest zone by 90\% between the 1960s and 2000s, and by 40\% in the more humid zone where the woody cover was already low in the 1960s. The woody vegetation changed in many places from an Acacia savanna into an open savanna with scattered bushes and few trees, concomitant with a shift in species composition. These changes took place during a prolonged drought (1969-1992), and were aggravated by increased grazing pressure after the construction of boreholes as evident from the loss of woody cover close to boreholes. A comparison of bird composition and densities in grazed and ungrazed areas and in three study sites intermittently surveyed between 1960 and 1994, with our surveys in the same sites in 2014-2015, revealed about 80\% losses for birds feeding on the ground. The increased grazing pressure of livestock must have caused a large reduction of the soil seed bank and most likely also of insects. Between 15 and 16 degrees W an estimated 8 million arboreal birds, mainly migrants, and 30 million ground-feeding birds, mainly granivorous residents, lost their habitat. Assuming that this zone is representative for the Sahelian rangelands as a whole, 1.5-2.0 billion birds have lost their habitat in half a century.},

Validation data sets were dichotomized according to the results of a virus neutralization test in sera obtained from RVF-endemic (Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda, and Yemen) and RVF-free countries (France, Poland, and the USA). Cut-off values were defined using the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis. Estimates of the diagnostic specificity of the RVFV rNP I-ELISA in animals from RVF-endemic countries ranged from 98.6\% (cattle) to 99.5\% (sheep) while in those originating from RVF-free countries, they ranged from 97.7\% (sheep) to 98.1\% (goats). Estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity in ruminants from RVF-endemic countries ranged from 90.7\% (cattle) to 100\% (goats). The results of this large-scale international validation study demonstrate the high diagnostic accuracy of the RVFV rNP I-ELISA. Standard incubation and inactivation procedures evaluated did not have an adverse effect on the detectable levels of the anti-RVFV IgG in ruminant sera and thus, together with recombinant antigen-based I-ELISA, provide a simple, safe, and robust diagnostic platform that can be automated and carried out outside expensive bio-containment facilities. These advantages are particularly important for less-resourced countries where there is a need to accelerate and improve RVF surveillance and research on epidemiology as well as to advance disease control measures.},

	abstract = {Bioinvasion is a major public health issue because it can lead to the introduction of pathogens in new areas and favours the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Rodents are prominent invasive species, and act as reservoirs in many zoonotic infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the link between the distribution and spread of two parasite taxa (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma lewisi) and the progressive invasion of Senegal by two commensal rodent species (the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus). M. m. domesticus and R. rattus have invaded the northern part and the central/southern part of the country, respectively. Native and invasive rodents were caught in villages and cities along the invasion gradients of both invaders, from coastal localities towards the interior of the land. Molecular diagnosis of the two trypanosomatid infections was performed using spleen specimens. In the north, neither M. m. domesticus nor the native species were carriers of these parasites. Conversely, in the south, 17.5\% of R. rattus were infected by L. major and 27.8\% by T. lewisi, while very few commensal native rodents were carriers. Prevalence pattern along invasion gradients, together with the knowledge on the geographical distribution of the parasites, suggested that the presence of the two parasites in R. rattus in Senegal is of different origins. Indeed, the invader R. rattus could have been locally infected by the native parasite L. major. Conversely, it could have introduced the exotic parasite T. lewisi in Senegal, the latter appearing to be poorly transmitted to native rodents. Altogether, these data show that R. rattus is a carrier of both parasites and could be responsible for the emergence of new foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis, or for the transmission of atypical human trypanosomiasis in Senegal.},

	abstract = {Background: The epidemiology of E. ruminantium infection in extensively managed young animals is not adequately understood. Thus in this study, we monitored the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response in extensively managed newborn lambs and kids at three sites in The Gambia. Method(s): We used a nested pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA in a longitudinal study to monitor the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response respectively, in 77 newborn lambs and kids under a traditional husbandry system at three sites (Kerr Seringe, Keneba, Bansang) in The Gambia where heartwater is known to occur. The animals were monitored for field tick infestation and the comparative performance of the two assays in detecting E. ruminantium infection was also assessed. Result(s): The infection rate detected by pCS20 PCR varied between 8.6\% and 54.8\% over the 162-day study period. Nineteen per cent of the animals in week 1 post-partum tested positive by pCS20 PCR with half of these infections (7/14) detected in the first 3 days after birth, suggesting that transmission other than by tick feeding had played a role. The earliest detectable A. variegatum infestation in the animals occurred in week 16 after birth. Antibodies detected by MAP1-B ELISA also varied, between 11.5\% and 90\%. Although there is considerable evidence that this assay can detect false positives and due to this and other reasons serology is not a reliable predictor of infection at least for heartwater. In contrast to the pCS20 PCR, the serological assay detected the highest proportion of positive animals in week 1 with a gradual decline in seropositivity with increasing age. The pCS20 PCR detected higher E. ruminantium prevalence in the animals with increasing age and both the Spearman's rank test (rs = -0.1512; P = 0.003) and kappa statistic (-0.091 to 0.223) showed a low degree of agreement between the two assays. Conclusion(s): The use of pCS20 PCR supported by transmission studies and clinical data could provide more accurate information on heartwater epidemiology in endemic areas and single-occasion testing of an animal may not reveal its true infection status. The view is supported because both the vector and vertical transmission may play a vital role in the epidemiology of heartwater in young small ruminants; the age range of 4 and 12 weeks corresponds to the period of increased susceptibility to heartwater in traditionally managed small ruminants. © 2007 Faburay et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

A total of 954 animals were caught during bimonthly capture sessions over a two-year period. Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively. of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

Their mobility is often a source of conflict with farmers in the areas crossed, and helps spread diseases such as Rift Valley Fever. Knowledge of the routes followed by herds is therefore core to guiding the implementation of preventive and control measures for transboundary animal diseases, land use planning and conflict management. However, the lack of quantitative data on livestock movements, together with the high temporal and spatial variability of herd movements, has so far hampered the production of fine resolution maps of animal movements. This paper proposes a general framework for mapping potential paths for livestock movements and identifying areas of high animal passage potential for those movements. The method consists in combining the information contained in livestock mobility networks with landscape connectivity, based on different mobility conductance layers. We illustrate our approach with a livestock mobility network in Senegal and Mauritania in the 2014 dry and wet seasons.},

This study maps out the effect of AMR originating from poultry production in Senegal and highlights the entry points for interventions from stakeholders' perspectives. A causal loop diagram (CLD) was developed following a group model building procedure with 20 stakeholders and integrated with network analysis by translating the CLD into an unweighted directed network. Results indicate that with an eigenvector centrality of 1, 0.85, and 0.74, the production cost, on-farm profit, and on-farm productivity, respectively are the most ranked influential variables driving the complexity of AMR in the poultry production system. Two reinforcing feedback loops highlight the dual benefits of improving on-farm productivity and increasing on-farm profit. However, one balancing feedback loop that revolves around the causal link between producers' investment in qualified human resource personnel to ensure good farm management practices underline the financial implication of producers' investment decisions. The findings provide precursory groundings for the development of a quantitative SD model, the formulation of intervention scenarios and ex-ante impact assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions.},

Genetic studies are restricted to a small number of isolates and based on molecular markers that evolve too slowly to resolve the relationships between American and West African populations and, thus, unable us to uncover the recent history of T. vivax in the New World. Methods: T. vivax genetic diversity, population structure and the source of outbreaks was investigated through the microsatellite multiloci (7 loci) genotype (MLGs) analysis in South America (47isolates from Brazil, Venezuela and French Guiana) and West Africa (12 isolates from The Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin and Nigeria). Relationships among MLGs were explored using phylogenetic, principal component and STRUCTURE analyses. Results: Although closely phylogenetically related, for the first time, genetic differences were detected between T. vivax isolates from South America (11 genotypes/47 isolates) and West Africa (12 genotypes/12 isolates) with no MLGs in common. Diversity was far greater across West Africa than in South America, where genotypes from Brazil (MLG1-6), Venezuela (MLG7-10) and French Guiana (MLG11) shared similar but not identical allele composition. No MLG was exclusive to asymptomatic (endemic areas) or sick (outbreaks in non-endemic areas) animals, but only MLGs1, 2 and 3 were responsible for severe haematological and neurological disorders. Conclusions: Our results revealed closely related genotypes of T. vivax in Brazil and Venezuela, regardless of endemicity and clinical conditions of the infected livestock. The MLGs analysis from T. vivax across SA and WA support clonal propagation, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the SA populations examined here derived from common ancestors recently introduced from West Africa.

	abstract = {Dromedary camels are natural host of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, there are limited studies of MERS-CoV infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dromedaries. We expanded our surveillance among camels in Egypt, Tunisia, and Senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camels. A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90\% PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6\%) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8\%) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9\%) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to {\textgreater}=1:320. We detected MERS-CoV RNA in swabs from three sheep (1.2\%) of 254 and five goats (4.1\%) of 121 from Egypt and Senegal, as well as one cow (1.9\%) of 53 and three donkeys (7.1\%) of 42 from Egypt. Partial sequences of the RT-PCR amplicons confirmed specificity of the results. This study showed that domestic livestock in contact with MERS-CoV infected camels may be at risk of infection. We recommend expanding current MERS-CoV surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dromedary camels. The segregation of camels from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered.},

Milk and component yields were monitored monthly by measurement of milk extracted for human use (milk offtake) plus that consumed by the calf, estimated from body weight changes. Least squares analyses of 668 lactations recorded over 4 yr gave mean lactation length, 420 d; milk offtake, 404.3 kg; fat, 5.1\%; protein, 3.2\%; calf weaning weight, 88.1 kg; and calving interval, 641 d. A productivity index incorporating milk offtake, calf weaning weight, calving rate, and viability gave a mean annual 140.6 kg of weaner calf plus the weight equivalent of milk offtake per 100 kg of cow metabolic weight. The index was higher than that recorded for larger Zebu (Bos indicus) cattle managed under similar production systems elsewhere in Africa. These results show that the trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle appear to be more productive than previously thought and should therefore be considered when promoting livestock development in Africa, especially in tsetse-infested areas where other breeds cannot survive.},

	abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiases are not only of major public health concern, but can also have profound implications for livestock production and wildlife conservation. The zoonotic, multi-host nature of many digenean trematodes is a significant challenge for disease control programmes in endemic areas. However, our understanding of the epidemiological role that animal reservoirs, particularly wild hosts, may play in the transmission of zoonotic trematodiases suffers a dearth of information, with few, if any, standardised, reliable diagnostic tests available. We combined qualitative and quantitative data derived from post-mortem examinations, coprological analyses using the Mini-FLOTAC technique, and molecular tools to assess parasite community composition and the validity of non-invasive methods to detect trematode infections in 89 wild Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) from northern Senegal. Result(s): Parasites isolated at post-mortem examination were identified as Plagiorchis sp., Anchitrema sp., Echinostoma caproni, Schistosoma mansoni, and a hybrid between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis. The reports of E. caproni and Anchitrema sp. represent the first molecularly confirmed identifications for these trematodes in definitive hosts of sub-Saharan Africa. Comparison of prevalence estimates derived from parasitological analysis at post-mortem examination and Mini-FLOTAC analysis showed non-significant differences indicating comparable results between the two techniques (P = 1.00 for S. mansoni; P = 0.85 for E. caproni; P = 0.83 for Plagiorchis sp.). A Bayesian model, applied to estimate the sensitivities of the two tests for the diagnosis of Schistosoma infections, indicated similar median posterior probabilities of 83.1\% for Mini-FLOTAC technique and 82.9\% for post-mortem examination (95\% Bayesian credible intervals of 64.0-94.6\% and 63.7-94.7\%, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that the Mini-FLOTAC could be applied as an alternative diagnostic technique for the detection of the zoonotic S. mansoni and other trematodes in rodent reservoirs. The implementation of non-invasive diagnostics in wildlife would offer numerous advantages over lethal sampling methodologies, with potential impact on control strategies of zoonotic helminthiases in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and on fostering a framework of animal use reduction in scientific practice.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a subset of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), are the etiologic agent of avian colibacillosis, one of the main causes of economic losses in the poultry industry. The aim of this study was to characterize E. coli isolated from diseased chickens in Senegal to elucidate their virulence potential and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A total of 58 isolates, each from a separate farm, were characterized for AMR, virulence, and AMR genes, phylogroup, serogroup, biofilm formation, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and for two isolates, whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Fifty isolates (86.2\%) were multidrug resistant. Many AMR genes were detected, including variants of blaCTX-M encoding resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (five isolates [8.6\%]). Most fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible isolates (21/26) were carriers of mutations in gyrA (Ser83Leu, Asp87Asn, and/or Asp87Tyr) and/or parC (Ser80Ile) genes. Forty-nine (84.5\%) isolates exhibited at least one of the virulence markers of APEC, among which 23 (39.7\%) were defined as potential virulent APEC. In addition, 10 isolates, of which 9 were defined as APEC, carried virulence profiles corresponding to ExPEC. Seven isolates, of which six were classified as ExPEC, belonged to phylo-serogroup F-O25, and following WGS of two of these isolates, were found to belong to the serotype O25:H1 and to the sequence type ST624. Some isolates classified as ExPEC, including F-O25, were found to strongly produce biofilm, suggesting their capability to persist for long time in the environment. F-O25-isolates, although found in different widely separated farms, formed a single cluster that included clones, suggesting that these isolates may have originated from a common source. Taken together, these results suggest that some E. coli involved in chicken colibacillosis in Senegal may pose a human health risk.© Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

Human encroachment has taken a toll on this great ape due to fragmented habitat and the exchange of pathogens. This epidemiological study investigated the occurrence and genetic diversity of intestinal and blood parasites in faecal samples from wild chimpanzees living in the Dindefelo Community Nature Reserve, Senegal. We paid special attention to potential human-driven sources of infection and transmission pathways. Potential diarrhoea-causing protist parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, Entamoeba histolytica) were detected at low infection rates (and densities) or absent, whereas commensals (Entamoeba dispar) or protist of uncertain pathogenicity (Blastocystis sp.) were far more abundant. We detected Sarcocystis spp. in chimpanzee faeces. Blood protist parasites such as Plasmodium spp. and Trypanosoma brucei spp. (the etiological agents of malaria and sleeping sickness, respectively, in humans) were also found at low prevalences, but microfilariae of the nematode Mansonella perstans were frequently found. Molecular analyses primarily revealed host-adapted species/genotypes and an apparent absence of gastrointestinal clinical manifestations in infected chimpanzees. Zoonotic events of still unknown frequency and directionality may have taken part between wild chimpanzees and humans sharing natural habitats and resources.Wild chimpanzee populations in West Africa (Pan troglodytes verus) have dramatically decreased as a direct consequence of anthropogenic activities and infectious diseases. Little information is currently available on the epidemiology, pathogenic significance, and zoonotic potential of protist species in wild chimpanzees. This study investigates the occurrence and genetic diversity of intestinal and blood protists as well as filariae in faecal samples (n = 234) from wild chimpanzees in the Dindefelo Community Nature Reserve, Senegal. PCR-based results revealed the presence of intestinal potential pathogens (Sarcocystis spp.: 11.5\%; Giardia duodenalis: 2.1\%; Cryptosporidium hominis: 0.9\%), protist of uncertain pathogenicity (Blastocystis sp.: 5.6\%), and commensal species (Entamoeba dispar: 18.4\%; Troglodytella abrassarti: 5.6\%). Entamoeba histolytica, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Balantioides coli were undetected. Blood protists including Plasmodium malariae (0.4\%), Trypanosoma brucei (1.3\%), and Mansonella perstans (9.8\%) were also identified. Sanger sequencing analyses revealed host-adapted genetic variants within Blastocystis, but other parasitic pathogens (C. hominis, P. malariae, T. brucei, M. perstans) have zoonotic potential, suggesting that cross-species transmission between wild chimpanzees and humans is possible in areas where both species overlap. Additionally, we explored potential interactions between intestinal/blood protist species and seasonality and climate variables. Chimpanzees seem to play a more complex role on the epidemiology of pathogenic and commensal protist and nematode species than initially anticipated.},

Rodents, thus, pose a significant threat to public health. Previous studies in Senegal have shown that rodents harbour a diversity of microorganisms, including human pathogens. Our study aimed to monitor the prevalence of infectious agents in outdoor rodents, which can be the cause of epidemics. We screened 125 rodents (both native and expanding) from the Ferlo region, around Widou Thiengoly, for different microorganisms. Analysis, performed on rodent spleens, detected bacteria from the Anaplasmataceae family (20\%), Borrelia spp. (10\%), Bartonella spp. (24\%) and Piroplasmida (2.4\%). Prevalences were similar between native and the expanding (Gerbillus nigeriae) species, which has recently colonised the region. We identified Borrelia crocidurae, the agent responsible for tick-borne relapsing fever, which is endemic in Senegal. We also identified two other not-yet-described bacteria of the genera Bartonella and Ehrlichia that were previously reported in Senegalese rodents. Additionally, we found a potential new species, provisionally referred to here as Candidatus Anaplasma ferloense. This study highlights the diversity of infectious agents circulating in rodent populations and the importance of describing potential new species and evaluating their pathogenicity and zoonotic potential.},

This study aims to clarify the diversity of Avitellina tapeworms isolated from sheep and cattle in Senegal. In total, 613 adult Avitellina tapeworms were collected from sheep and cattle. Morphological analysis by the light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy identified three Avitellina "morphospecies": A. centripunctata and Avitellina sp.2 were detected in sheep while Avitellina sp.3 was identified in cattle. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the complete mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1) sequences revealed that 101 Avitellina tapeworms were divided into 54 haplotypes grouped into three clades, of which two were specific to sheep and one specific to cattle. Three morphospecies corresponded to each of three clades and the maximum pairwise divergence among the clades ranged from 9.7 to 18.5\% in cox1. The present study demonstrates the unexpected diversity of Avitellina tapeworms in domestic ruminants, and emphasize the necessity of re-evaluation of the taxonomy of the genus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Caves play an important ecological role for nonhuman primates in Africa and Asia. Savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes vents) living in the Mandingue plateau of Senegal and Mali use caves for thermoregulation, where these refugia provide a cool microclimate during the hot, dry season. In this study, we examined cave use frequency for a chimpanzee community in southeastern Senegal. We used images from a camera trap placed at the mouth of a large laterite cave to investigate the hypotheses that sex, reproductive state, and seasonality influence the frequency of cave use. The camera collected 14,053 still images of chimpanzees between 2011 and 2013 over 325 camera trap days. Our results indicate no difference in cave use frequency between males and females overall. However, female reproductive state did significantly influence cave use, with lactating mothers using the cave more frequently than both males and nonlactating females. Chimpanzees used the cave during the hottest times of the day and were more likely to visit the cave during periods of low water availability and high maximum temperatures associated with the dry season. These results suggest the importance of thermoregulation in extreme heat for all individuals, and specifically for lactating females with nursing infants that likely experience higher metabolic and hydration stress. This study provides insight into the dynamics of primate cave use by contributing evidence that chimpanwe cave use may be influenced by reproductive states in addition to thermoregulatory needs.},

The analysis of these trajectories would help to better understand their successes and failures. To this end, a comparative study of these programs is carried out based on published and unpublished scientific literature and interviews with stakeholders. The analysis first consisted in describing each program. A discussion is then held to assess the success and failure factors. This analysis showed that these factors depend on the interest of farmers in relation to their production objectives and practices, the strategy used, whether or not trypanotolerance is included in the selection criteria, and the mobilization of financial and human resources. These breeding programs have also generated a wealth of experience that could be used to improve current systems and build sustainable breeding programs for low-input livestock systems in developing countries.},

This distinction allows farmers to depict outcrossing as a form of breed diversification while underreporting its occurrence within village flocks.

This study aims to describe in Diaguiri: (1) the distribution of chimpanzee nests and the location of their core sleeping area, (2) the tree species used for nest building, (3) the association between nests and nesting tree heights, and (4) differences in nest decay rates between habitats. We surveyed 43 km of chimpanzee nesting habitats and recorded 871 nests in gallery forest and woodland habitats between March 2015 and June 2016. Diaguiri chimpanzees used at least 17 tree species for nest building, and 58.8\% of nests were in only 3 tree species: Pterocarpus erinaceus, Anogeissus leiocarpus and Diospyros mespiliformis. Nest decay rate was faster in gallery forests than in woodlands. These data are of great value for understanding habitat use by a Critically Endangered subspecies of savanna chimpanzee, for population density estimates of the species and for conservation programmes in this region and in savanna biomes.},

	abstract = {Senegal, located in West Africa, is an example of a low-to middle-income country where the govern-ment has prioritized improving livestock production self-sufficiency, with a strong focus on dairy. Among other initiatives, the use of exotic dairy cattle has been promoted, despite no evidence for the potential liveli-hood benefits (or otherwise) to smallholder farmers on adopting the new genetics. The current work fills this evidence gap by performing a farm-level economic study comparing the keeping of different breed and cross-breed types of dairy cattle under different management levels. Data for the study were obtained by monitoring 220 smallholder dairy cattle farms, with a combined cattle population of about 3,000 animals, over an almost 2-yr period. Findings of the study suggest that the most net-beneficial and cost-beneficial dairy cattle enterprise that could be used by the smallholder farmers was to keep crossbred indigenous zebu by exotic Bos taurus animals under management standards that are consid-ered good compared with local standards. This dairy enterprise type was 7.4-fold more net beneficial and had a 1.4-fold more favorable cost-benefit ratio than the traditional system of keeping indigenous zebu animals under poor (low-input) management. Interestingly, the keeping of (near) pure B. taurus dairy cattle resulted in the highest milk yields and thus benefit from milk, but was not the most net beneficial due to the high costs of keeping these animals, particularly in terms of feed. We also found that increasing the managementlevel of any of the breed or cross-breed types under consideration, including the indigenous zebu animals, resulted in an increased net benefit of 2.2-to 2.9-fold. Results of this economic analysis are discussed as part of a broader trade-off analysis, resulting in recommendations to strengthen the Senegal dairy sector. The combined intervention of improved dairy cattle genetics and management is considered a promising intervention to improve livelihoods of the rural poor as well as livestock production self-sufficiency for Senegal; some other system constraints are addressed.},

As referential models, apes provide insight into the evolution of hominin hunting, given their phylogenetic relatedness and challenges reconstructing extinct hominin behaviour from palaeoanthropological evidence. Among chimpanzees, adult males are usually the main hunters, capturing vertebrate prey by hand. Savannah chimpanzees (P. t. verus) at Fongoli, Senegal are the only known non-human population that systematically hunts vertebrate prey with tools, making them an important source for hypotheses of early hominin behaviour based on analogy. Here, we test the hypothesis that sex and age patterns in tool-assisted hunting (n = 308 cases) at Fongoli occur and differ from chimpanzees elsewhere, and we compare tool-assisted hunting to the overall hunting pattern. Males accounted for 70\% of all captures but hunted with tools less than expected based on their representation on hunting days. Females accounted for most tool-assisted hunting. We propose that social tolerance at Fongoli, along with the tool-assisted hunting method, permits individuals other than adult males to capture and retain control of prey, which is uncommon for chimpanzees. We assert that tool-assisted hunting could have similarly been important for early hominins.},

The aim of this study was to explain the high prevalence of R. felis infections in two rural Senegalese populations by an entomological, systematic monitoring protocol. A total of 232 fleas from three species (Ctenocephalides felis, Echidnophaga gallinacea, and Synosternus pallidus) were collected by candle trapping and manually from pets in the villages of Dielmo and Ndiop during the year 2010. The fleas were then tested for the presence of Bartonella and Rickettsia species. No fleas were found to be positive for any Bartonella species or R. felis. Surprisingly, we found that 91.4\% of S. pallidus were infected by a new Rickettsia species, which, based on sequence analysis of gltA, ompB, and two fragments of rpoB, was found to be closely related to R. felis.

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is widely distributed along the Senegal River Basin (SRB), affecting both the human population and their livestock. Damming of the Senegal River for irrigation purposes in the 1980s induced ecological changes that resulted in a large outbreak of Schistosoma mansoni, followed a few years later by an increase and spread of Schistosoma haematobium infections. The presence of hybrid crosses between the human and cattle schistosomes, S. haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, respectively, is adding complexity to the disease epidemiology in this area, and questions the strength of the species boundary between these two species. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of S. haematobium, S. bovis and their hybrids along the Senegal River basin using both microsatellite genetic markers and analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Human schistosome populations with a S. haematobium cox1 mtDNA profile and those with a S. bovis cox1 mtDNA profile (the so-called hybrids) appear to belong to a single randomly mating population, strongly differentiated from the pure S. bovis found in cattle. These results suggest that, in northern Senegal, a strong species boundary persists between human and cattle schistosome species and there is no prolific admixing of the populations. In addition, we found that in the SRB S. haematobium was spatially more differentiated in comparison to S. mansoni. This may be related either to the presence and susceptibility of the intermediate snail hosts, or to the colonisation history of the parasite.Copyright © 2019},

I predicted that apes would be more active at night during periods of greater lunar illuminosity given diurnal primates' lack of visual specializations for low-light conditions and in dry season months when water scarcity exacerbated heat stress. Materials and MethodsI observed chimpanzees for 403 hrs on 40 nights between 2007 and 2013 and categorized their activity as social, movement, or vocalization. I scored their activity as occurring after moonrise or before moonset and considered the influence of moon phase (fuller versus darker phases) as well as season on chimpanzee nocturnal behavior in the analyses. ResultsResults indicate that apes were more active after moonrise or before moonset during fuller moon phases in the dry season but not the wet season. Most night-time activity involved movement (travel or forage), followed by social behavior, and long-distance vocal communication. DiscussionAnimals in highly seasonal habitats often exhibit thermoregulatory adaptations but, like other primates, chimpanzees lack physiological mechanisms to combat thermal stress. This study provides evidence that they may exhibit behaviors that allow them to avoid high temperatures in a savanna environment, such as feeding and socializing at night during the hottest time of year and in the brightest moon phases. The results support theories invoking thermal stress as a selective pressure for hominins in open environments where heat would constrain temporal foraging niches, and suggest an adaptability of sleeping patterns in response to external factors.},

The use of vocalisations as a primary mode of communication has been the focus of much research, especially in attempts to understand the origins of human language, with a major focus on anthropoid primates and diurnal lemurs. Over the last decade, technological advances have allowed researchers to begin to conduct in-depth investigations into the communication systems exhibited by the nocturnal and cathemeral prosimian primates, including tarsiers, lemurs and lorises. Understanding how nocturnal prosimians use visual, olfactory and auditory cues is vital for reconstructing the origins of primate communication systems. In this special issue, we highlight some of the more exciting advances in the communication strategies of the prosimians. Contributions come from work conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Rwanda, Madagascar and the Indonesian islands of Java and Sulawesi. Topics will include: the description of novel ultrasonic vocalisations, including frequency and function of these newly discovered calls; the possible use of vocalisations to navigate and assemble at sleep sites; the importance of species-specific contact vocalisations for the identification of new species; the use of urinary and glandular signals to communicate and the methods developed to understand this complex communication in the field; the use of vocalisations for niche separation among nocturnal primates from mainland Africa and Madagascar; and whether or not we can use new technologies to discern whether prosimians use vocalisations for individual identification of group members. We discuss the importance of new field methods including novel equipment and techniques, the use of vocalisation to influence conservation practices and the importance of comparing across prosimian taxa to reconstruct the communication systems of our early primate ancestors.

The performance of this Gn based ELISA is validated using a panel of almost 2000 field samples from sheep and goats from Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda and Yemen. All serum samples were also tested by virus neutralization test (VNT), the gold standard method for RVFV serological testing. Compared to the VNT results the Gn based ELISA proved to have an excellent sensitivity (94.56\%) and specificity (95.57\%). Apart from establishing this new diagnostic assay, these results also demonstrate a close correlation between the presence of RVFV Gn and neutralizing antibodies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A ranking of the numbers of tsetse blood-meals from cattle, small ruminants and equines (1:0.06: {\textgreater} 0.03) corresponded with the estimated biomass of these livestock groups (1:0.09:0.05). Observations on the grazing ranges of livestock showed that, while cattle foraged widely into tsetse-infested habitat, sheep, goats and donkeys remained closer to the villages.

No difference in antibody levels to Amblyomma variegatum infestation could be detected between the two breeds.

Some are either nonpathogenic or their detrimental effects on the host are not yet known. Others lead to serious diseases that can even be fatal. Their survey remains of great importance for public health and animal conservation. Fecal samples from gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and humans living in same area in the Republic of Congo, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from Senegal and one other from the Republic of Congo, Guinea baboons (Papio papio)from Senegal, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) from Djibouti and Barbary macaques(Macaca sylvanus) from Algeria, were collected. DNA was extracted and screened using specific qPCR assays for the presence of a large number of helminths and protozoa. Positive samples were then amplified in standard PCRs and sequenced when possible. Overall, infection rate was 36.5\% in all non-human primates (NHPs) and 31.6\% in humans. Great apes were more often infected (63.6\%) than monkeys (7.3\%). At least twelve parasite species, including ten nematodes and two protozoa were discovered in NHPs and five species, including four nematodes and a protozoan in humans. The prevalences ofGiarida lamblia,Necator americanus, Enterobius vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoraliswere similar between gorillas and human community co-habiting the same forest ecosystem in the Republic of Congo. In addition, human specificMansonella perstans(5.1\%) and otherMansonellaspp. (5.1\%) detected in these gorillas suggest a possible cross-species exchange. Low prevalence (2\%) ofAscaris lumbricoides, Enterobius vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoraliswere observed in chimpanzees, as well as a high prevalence ofAbbreviata caucasica(57.1\%), which should be considered carefully as this parasite can affect other NHPs, animals and humans. The Barbary macaques were less infected (7.2\%) andOesophagostomum muntiacumwas the main parasite detected (5.8\%). Finally, we report the presence ofPeloderasp. and an environmental Nematoda DNAs in chimpanzee feces,Nematodasp. andBodosp. in gorillas, as well as DNA of uncharacterized Nematoda in apes and humans, but with a relatively lower prevalence in humans. Prevalence of extraintestinal parasites remains underestimated since feces are not the suitable sampling methods. Using non-invasive sampling (feces) we provide important information on helminths and protozoa that can infect African NHPs and human communities living around them. Public health and animal conservation authorities need to be aware of these infections, as parasites detected in African NHPs could affect both human and other animals' health.},

We analyze the foresight processes in five companion modelling (ComMod) projects on the co-evolution of extensive husbandry systems (EHS) and territories scale in France, Senegal, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The processes are broken down according to the scenario study objectives, to the method of construction and to the parameters associated with models and simulations. Comparative analysis contributes to improving the design of future ComMod experiments on EHS and reveals a more operational definition of local, regional and global issues which the EES of these regions will face in the next decade.},

Data relevant to addressing this deficiency (dental casts, photographs, and somatic measurements) were collected during the trapping of 267Guinea baboons in the Department of Kedougou, southeastern Senegal, as part of a 1 ong-term study of sylvatic, mosquito-borne viruses. Relative ages of the baboons were assessed through a combination of dental eruption and tooth-wear patterns. All age groups occurred in the sample, indicating they represent a reasonable cross-section of the population. The dental eruption sequence for Guinea baboons was found to differ somewhat from both yellow and olive baboons, as upper 12 emerges only after lower 12 is completely erupted. In male Guinea baboons, upper P3 erupts after both M2s are fully erupted, but in yellow and olive baboons both P3s erupt isochronally with M2. Male Guinea baboons are more similar to yellow than to olive baboons in having upper canines erupt after lower P3, and lower M3 before upper M3. Plots of body weight and other measurements against age demonstrate female progenesis, with females ceasing their growth at about age five and males continuing to grow until about age eight, similar to other baboons. At age eight, body weight sexual dimorphism is high, with males (n=15) averaging 19.05 kg and females (n=13) averaging 10.92 kg. Measurements for all body proportions were found to be less in the oldest members of the sample, possibly tracking local climate history (severe drought) experienced during their developmental years.},

	abstract = {The multimammate rat Mastomys huberti is a Sahelian species restricted to West Africa. Throughout its distribution area, the species is associated with humid habitats, flood plains and ponds, which make its current distribution highly fragmented. Knowing that humid and dry climatic phases regularly alternated along the Quaternary in West Africa, it can be postulated that the evolutionary history of the species and its genetic variation largely reflect these climatic oscillations. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of M. huberti populations across the totality of the species' geographical range (Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania). We found that cytochrome b sequence variation is partitioned into four divergent clades (mean Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances varying from 0.57 to 3.08\%) corresponding to distinct geographical regions. We dated the separation events of these clades between 0.93 and 0.17 million years ago, suggesting that M. huberti history was strongly influenced by the Quaternary climatic variations and related hydrographic network changes. Relationships between lineages and the partitioning of genetic diversity suggest the occurrence of two refuges along the Atlantic coast during arid periods. Moreover, the species' current range results from a stepwise colonization from west to east. M. huberti colonized recently the Inner Delta of Niger River in Mali, probably during a humid episode some 0.6 million years ago. Demographically stable and highly diversified populations were found in South Senegal and Guinea while populations in North Senegal and in Mali experienced low numbers followed by a demographic expansion during the African Humid Period (c. 14 800-5500 BP). During the last arid period (c. 23 000-18 000 years ago), Malian populations found refuge in the northern parts of the Inner Delta of the Niger River, then expended to the southern parts of the delta and along the course of the Niger River downstream Tombouctou. More recently, M. huberti would have rapidly expanded into irrigated areas along the Senegal River and along the Canal du Sahel, Mali, reflecting the invasive and the pest character of this species.},

Location Sahel and Sudan savannas, Africa. Methods We sequenced the whole cytochrome b gene in 211 individuals from 59 localities distributed from Senegal to Ethiopia. Sequence data were analysed using both phylogenetic (several rooted tree-construction methods, median-joining networks) and population genetic methods (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions). Results Haplotypes were distributed into four major monophyletic groups corresponding to distinct geographical regions across a west-east axis. Diversification events were estimated to have occurred between 1.16 and 0.18 Ma. Main conclusions Vicariance events related to the fragmentation of savanna habitats during the Pleistocene era may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. Genetic structure was consistent with a role of major Sahelian rivers as significant barriers to west-east dispersal.

	abstract = {Trematodes of the genus Plagiorchis have a wide geographical distribution and can exploit a variety of hosts. The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal DNA, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial DNA, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.Copyright © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {The history of plague in Africa during the period 1935-49 is reviewed. Much of the information derives from a questionnaire sent to all African territories in 1950. The annual incidence of plague in Africa declined, particularly from 1946 onwards. In 1949, under 400 cases were reported, as compared with over 6,000 in 1935. By the end of 1949, plague was still active in the Belgian Congo, Kenya and Tanganyika, Madagascar, and southern Africa. No cases were reported from Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, or Uganda during 1949. A comparison of the seasonal incidence of plague with prevailing atmospheric conditions (temperature and rainfall) in African territories shows that human plague is more frequent in warm moist weather-60 degrees -80 degrees F (15 degrees -27 degrees C)-than in hot dry, or cold, weather-over 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) or under 60 degrees F (15 degrees C). The highlands of equatorial Africa and of Madagascar appear to provide the optimum environment for the persistence of plague on the domestic (murine) plane and the high-veld and Kalahari of southern Africa on the sylvatic plane. The rat (Rattus rattus) and the multimammate mouse (R. (Mastomys) natalensis) and their fleas Xenopsylla brasiliensis and X. cheopis appear to be mainly responsible for the persistence of the reservoir in the East African highlands; R. rattus and X. cheopis play this role in Madagascar. The gerbils (Tatera and Desmodillus) and their burrow fleas X. philoxera and X. piriei are the main reservoirs of plague in southern Africa. Within these areas, Pasteurella pestis finds an environment suitable for its continued survival; the conditions seem to be comparable to those defined as obtaining in endemic centres in India. Elsewhere in Africa such endemic centres do not appear to exist.},

About half (51.6\%) of 639 sheep were positive, with seroprevalence rates per site varying between 6.9\% and 100\%. The highest seroprevalence was detected in the western part of the country (88.1\% in the Western Division and 62.1\% in the Lower River Division). Sheep in the two easterly divisions (Central River and Upper River divisions) showed the lowest seroprevalence of 29.3\% and 32.4\%, respectively, while those in the North Bank Division showed an intermediate prevalence of 40.6\%. In goats, less than one-third (30.3\%) of 679 animals tested were positive. The highest seroprevalence was detected in goats in the North Bank Division (59\%) and Western Division (44.1\%). Goats in the Lower River Division showed an intermediate level of 21.9\%, whereas the lowest rates were found in the eastern part of the country (4.8\% in the Central River Division and 2.3\% in the Upper River Division). At nearly all sites, seroprevalence rates were higher in sheep than in goats. The results show a gradient of increasing heartwater risk for susceptible small ruminants from the east to the west of The Gambia. These findings need to be taken into consideration when future livestock-upgrading programs are implemented. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Two thermotolerant and desiccation tolerant lactic acid bacteria ( TDLAB) were pointed out from twenty isolated strains from soils and dried chicken faeces. Samples were collected in poultry farms in the vicinity of Dakar, Senegal ( West Africa). The two new isolates were called Sp. 4 ( Sp. 4= CWBI- B534= LMG7278) and Sp. 20 ( Sp. 20= CWBI- B545= LMG7279). They are Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, and non-spore-forming rods. Both produce D/L lactic acid via homofermentative pathway. Growth of the strains occurred between 15 degrees C and 44 degrees C. The optimum temperature for growth was in 30 degrees C- 37 degrees C temperature and pH 3-8 range. Desiccation treatment in glycerol showed 30\% survival rates. Complex total fatty acid pattern of the strains showed the presence of C-14: 0, C-16: 0, C-16: 1, C-18: 0, C-18: 1, C-18: 2, C-18: 3. SDS-PAGE of total protein of both strains placed them in L. plantarum group. AFLP analysis showed a phylogenetic proximity of the two strains with L. plantarum stricto sensu species. Specific amplified 16s rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of the 16S rDNA gene, however, showed that these thermotolerant strains were not L. plantarum. ITS sequencing revealed that Sp. 20 (LMG 7279) could be classed into Lactobacillus paraplantarum species since the short sequence of ITS showed 95\% of similarity with reference species. Polyphasic identification shows that Sp. 4, ( the type strain is LMG 7278(T)) represent a new species within the genus Lactobacillus with only 88\%+/-1 ITS sequence similarity with reference species.

	abstract = {IntroductionThe role of wildlife in the transmission of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) is suspected but scarcely reported in current studies. Therefore, we studied the dynamics and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales in antibiotic-limited areas of Senegal. Materials and MethodsWe collected fecal samples from monkeys and apes (N = 226) and non-fecal environmental samples (N = 113) from Senegal in 2015 and 2019. We grew the samples on selective media, subsequently isolated AMR Enterobacterales, and then sequenced their genomes. ResultsWe isolated 72 different Enterobacterales among which we obtained a resistance rate of 65\% for colistin (N = 47/72) and 29\% for third generation-cephalosporin (C3G) (29\%, N = 21/72). Interestingly, almost 46\% of our isolates, among Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter cronae and Klebsiella aerogenes, belong to 34 new STs. Moreover, the genes bla(CTX-M-15), bla(TEM1B), sul2, dfrA14, qnrs, aph(3 ''), aph(6), tetA, and tetR harbored within a transposon on the IncY plasmid of ST224 Escherichia coli were transferred and inserted into a ST10 E. coli phage coding region. ConclusionWildlife constitutes a rich, unexplored reservoir of natural microbial diversity, AMR genes and international resistant clones pathogenic in humans. The presence of a transposon that carries AMR genes is intriguing since no antibiotics are used in the non-human primates we studied.},

According to the expectations based on the degree of habitat patchiness (which is higher for commensal populations in this rural area), genetic diversity was lower and genetic differentiation was higher in commensal populations of Mastomys natalensis than in wild populations of Mastomys erythroleucus. Contrasting estimates of effective dispersal and current migration rates corroborates previous data on differences in social structure between the two species. Isolation-by-distance analyses showed that human-mediated dispersal is not a major factor explaining the pattern of genetic differentiation for M. natalensis, and that gene flow is high and random between M. erythroleucus populations at the spatial scale considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Native to Africa, Gambian giant pouched rats (Gambian rats; Cricetomys gambianus Waterh.) are a threatening invasive species on a Florida island, Grassy Key. Gambian giant pouched rats shifted from a domestic pet to invading species after suspected release from a pet breeder. Because of the large size of Gambian rats (weighing up to 2.8 kg), they pose a serious threat to native species (particularly nesting species) and agricultural crops, especially if Gambian rats invade mainland Florida. Also, Gambian rats pose a threat from disease, as they were implicated in a monkeypox outbreak in the midwestern United States in 2003. The United States Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services has initiated eradication and detection efforts in the Florida Keys, but trapping the sparse population of Gambian rats has proven difficult., RESULTS: Fifteen attractants that could be used in traps for capturing or detecting single or paired Gambian rats were tested. It was found that conspecific scents (i.e. feces and urine) from other Gambian rats were the best treatment for attracting single and paired Gambian rats. Single Gambian rats explored more attractant types than paired Gambian rats., CONCLUSIONS: Effective attractants for use with Gambian rats have been identified, and multiple attractant types should be used to capture or detect the sparse population. It is recommended that mainly urine and feces from Gambian rats be used, but peanut butter, anise, ginger and fatty acid scent could also be useful for attracting the currently small population of Gambian rats on Grassy Key.},

	abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of global medical and veterinary importance. As efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem and interrupt transmission gather momentum, the potential zoonotic risk posed by livestock Schistosoma species via viable hybridisation in sub-Saharan Africa have been largely overlooked. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, distribution, and multi-host, multiparasite transmission cycle of Haematobium group schistosomiasis in Senegal, West Africa. Method(s): In this epidemiological study, we carried out systematic surveys in definitive hosts (humans, cattle, sheep, and goats) and snail intermediate hosts, in 2016-18, in two areas of Northern Senegal: Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, where transmission is perennial; and Barkedji and Linguere, where transmission is seasonal. The occurrence and distribution of Schistosoma species and hybrids were assessed by molecular analyses of parasitological specimens obtained from the different hosts. Children in the study villages aged 5-17 years and enrolled in school were selected from school registers. Adults (aged 18-78 years) were self-selecting volunteers. Livestock from the study villages in both areas were also randomly sampled, as were post-mortem samples from local abattoirs. Additionally, five malacological surveys of snail intermediate hosts were carried out at each site in open water sources used by the communities and their animals. Finding(s): In May to August, 2016, we surveyed 375 children and 20 adults from Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, and 201 children and 107 adults from Barkedji and Linguere; in October, 2017, to January, 2018, we surveyed 386 children and 88 adults from Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, and 323 children and 85 adults from Barkedji and Linguere. In Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in children was estimated to be 87\% (95\% CI 80-95) in 2016 and 88\% (82-95) in 2017-18. An estimated 63\% (in 2016) and 72\% (in 2017-18) of infected children were shedding Schistosoma haematobium-Schistosoma bovis hybrids. In adults in Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was estimated to be 79\% (52-97) in 2016 and 41\% (30-54) in 2017-18, with 88\% of infected samples containing S haematobium-S bovis hybrids. In Barkedji and Linguere the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in children was estimated to be 30\% (23-38) in 2016 and 42\% (35-49) in 2017-18, with the proportion of infected children found to be shedding S haematobium-S bovis hybrid miracidia much lower than in Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers (11\% in 2016 and 9\% in 2017-18). In adults in Barkedji and Linguere, the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was estimated to be 26\% (17-36) in 2016 and 47\% (34-60) in 2017-18, with 10\% of infected samples containing S haematobium-S bovis hybrids. The prevalence of S bovis in the sympatric cattle population of Richard Toll and the Lac de Guiers was 92\% (80-99), with S bovis also found in sheep (estimated prevalence 14\% [5-31]) and goats (15\% [5-33]). In Barkedji and Linguere the main schistosome species in livestock was Schistosoma curassoni, with an estimated prevalence of 73\% (48-93) in sheep, 84\% (61-98) in goats and 8\% (2-24) in cattle. S haematobium-S bovis hybrids were not found in livestock. In Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers 35\% of infected Bulinus spp snail intermediate hosts were found to be shedding S haematobium-S bovis hybrids (68\% shedding S haematobium; 17\% shedding S bovis); however, no snails were found to be shedding S haematobium hybrids in Barkedji and Linguere (29\% shedding S haematobium; 71\% shedding S curassoni). Interpretation(s): Our findings suggest that hybrids originate in humans via zoonotic spillover from livestock populations, where schistosomiasis is co-endemic. Introgressive hybridisation, evolving host ranges, and wider ecosystem contexts could affect the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis and other pathogens, demonstrating the need to consider control measures within a On Health framework.

	abstract = {Background. West African landscapes are largely characterised by complex agroforest mosaics. Although the West African forests are considered a nonhuman primate hotspot, knowledge on the distribution of many species is often lacking and out-of-date. Considering the fast-changing nature of the landscapes in this region, up-to-date information on primate occurrence is urgently needed, particularly of taxa such as colobines, which may be more sensitive to habitat modification than others. Understanding wildlife occurrence and mechanisms of persistence in these human-dominated landscapes is fundamental for developing effective conservation strategies. Methods. In this paper, we aim to review current knowledge on the distribution of three threatened primates in Guinea-Bissau and neighbouring regions, highlighting research gaps and identifying priority research and conservation action. We conducted a systematic literature review of primate studies from 1976 to 2016 in Guinea-Bissau, southern Senegal and western Guinea (Boke Region). We mapped historical observation records of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), Temmincks red colobus (Pilicolobus badius temminckii) and king colobus (Colobus polykomos), including our preliminary survey data from Dulombi, a newly established National Park (NP) in Guinea-Bissau. Results. We found 151 documents, including 87 journal articles, that contained field data on primates in this region. In Guinea-Bissau, nearly all studies focussed south of the Corubal River, including mainly Cantanhez, Cufada, and Boe NPs. In Senegal, most of the data came from Fongoli and Niokolo-Koba NP. In Boke (Guinea) studies are few, with the most recent data coming from Sangaredi. In Dulombi NP we recorded eight primate species, including chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus. Across the selected region, chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus were reported in eleven, twelve and seven protected areas, respectively. Discussion. Our study demonstrates large geographical research gaps particularly for the two colobines. For the first time after more than two decades, we confirm the presence of red colobus and king colobus north of the Corubal River in Guinea-Bissau. The little information available from large parts of the red colobus range raises questions regarding levels of population fragmentation in this species, particularly in Casamance and across northern Guinea-Bissau. There are still no records demonstrating the occurrence of king colobus in Senegal, and the presence of a viable population in north-eastern Guinea-Bissau remains uncertain. While the occurrence of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal is well documented, data from Boke (Guinea) are sparse and out-of-date. Our approach-the mapping of data gathered from a systematic literature review-allows us to provide recommendations for selecting future geographical survey locations and planning further research and conservation strategies in this region.},

The PRA was then used in conjunction with gross margin analyses and discounted cash flows to assess the social, economic and technical constraints to the supplementation of cattle in The Gambia. The PRA survey indicated that cattle are primarily kept as a means of savings, Farmers placed a value on manure that equalled domestic milk consumption and exceeded that of milk sales. Equines, bulls, and cows in one district, were important for draught and transport; small ruminants were kept primarily, as an investment and for ceremonial purposes. The gross margin analyses of productivity responses indicated that supplementation is not financially attractive in the short-term, i.e. for a single lactation or fattening period. However, discounted cash flows demonstrated that supplementation is worthwhile in the long-term particularly for draught cattle where multiple benefits accrue. Adoption of long-term supplementation strategies in cows is further constrained by transport, feed availability and the distribution of costs and benefits between cattle owners and hired herdsman.

	abstract = {The productivity of trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle, kept under traditional management conditions in The Gambia, West Africa, was assessed by the regular, monthly collection of health and production parameters in two study areas. The study areas were selected because of differences in tsetse challenge. Performance traits were used to build up an index to estimate the productivity of village N'Dama cattle. The productivity index per 100 kg cow maintained per year varied from 37.2 kg in the study area of Keneba village (with a low tstse challenge) to 21.4 kg for cattle kept near the villages of Tuba and Sambelkunda, an area which had a high tsetse challenge. Average age at first calving was 4.5 or 5.0 years depending on the study area, calving intervals were 623 or 703 days and there was an average 12\% loss of body weight in adult females during the dry season. The productivity indices of village N'Dama cattle in The Gambia compare favourably with similar indices for trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds elsewhere in Africa, and show that even under harsh conditions and with high tsetse challenge, they are able to effectively produce milk and meat for the rural population.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the study: To establish relative efficacy of Diminasan , Cymelarsan and Samorin in clinical cases of equine trypanosomiasis in a hyperendemic area. Method(s): Horses and donkeys were examined (history, clinical examination, blood sample for PCV/TP and PCR) in ten villages in The Gambia. Inclusion criteria were selected to encompass clinical signs correlated to trypanosoma sp. infection (two of five: anaemia (PCV{\textless}24\%), poor body condition ({\textless}=1.5), limb or ventral oedema, abortion or pyrexia). Treatments were randomised and follow up was performed at one and two weeks with repeat examination and blood samples. DNA was extracted from a subsection of the blood samples (n = 18) in a standard manner (Qiagen Maxi kit). PCR was performed with primers for Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax. The products were run on gel electrophoresis to identify positive samples. Result(s): Six hundred and seventy six equines were examined; 254 (145 donkeys and 109 horses) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and received trypanosomiasis treatment. PCV was significantly increased at 1 and 2 weeks post treatment for all groups (P {\textless} 0.001). The increase was most marked in Diminasan and Samorin. Preliminary PCR results (n = 18) identified 100\% (18/ 18) positive for {\textgreater}=1 trypanosome before treatment, 33\% had mixed infections (6/18). 22\% (4/18) remained positive on PCR following treatment. Conclusion(s): Samorin and Diminasan caused the most profound improvement in PCV. Preliminary PCR results confirm suitability of inclusion criteria and support importance of further PCR analysis including pre- and post-treatment qPCR to quantify parasitaemia.},

This review describes Salmonella contamination of food, poultry, and the farming environment, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and serotypes of Salmonella, as well as the farming systems, antimicrobial use (AMU), hygiene, and husbandry conditions used to rear poultry in Africa. Using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analysis) guidelines, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases were searched using a set of predefined keywords. Full-length research articles in English were examined for the period 2010-2020 and relevant information extracted for the narrative synthesis. Of the articles that met the inclusion criteria, 63.1\% were conducted on farms and among households, while 36.9\% were undertaken at government-controlled laboratories, which quarantine imported birds, processing plants, and retail outlets. The farming systems were intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive. AMU was described in 11.5\% of the studies and varied within and across countries. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella isolates were detected in 30 studies and the prevalence ranged from 12.1\% in Zimbabwe to 100\% in Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. A total of 226 different Salmonella serotypes were reported. Twenty-four (19.7\%) of the studies reported food-borne Salmonella contamination in eggs, poultry, and poultry products at retail outlets and processing plants. The apparent extensive use of antimicrobials and circulation of MDR Salmonella isolates of various serotypes in Africa is a concern. It is important to implement stricter biosecurity measures on farms, regulate the use of antimicrobials and implement surveillance systems, in addition to food safety measures to monitor the quality of poultry and poultry products for human consumption.© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.},

Among mammals, rodent species, including the house mouse Mus musculus, are identified as major invaders with profound impacts on native biodiversity, human health and activities. Though contemporary rodent invasions are described on several islands, there are few data describing ongoing house mouse invasions in continental areas. We first outline the known picture of the distribution of the house mouse in Africa. We then describe the ongoing range expansion of the house mouse in Senegal, in order to update its distribution area, assess the location of the invasion front, describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of the invasion at the country scale and evaluate its impact on native small mammal communities. We briefly review the worldwide status of the house mouse, with special focus on its situation in Africa. Focusing on Senegal, we then use historical records and a large body of spatio-temporal indoor trapping data obtained from small mammal communities over the last 30 years to analyse the invasion dynamics of the subspecies at the scale of the country. The geographic range of the invasive house mouse is surprisingly poorly known in Africa. In Senegal, we document a large range expansion of the subspecies in human settlements over the whole country within the last 30 years. The invasion is still ongoing further east and south within the country, and has major consequences for small mammal communities and thus probably for risks associated with zoonotic diseases.},

Here, we examined the function of meat sharing by Fongoli chimpanzees, a community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in southeastern Senegal.Materials and Methods: We tested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that have been used to explain patterns of food sharing: kin selection, generalized reciprocity, and meat-for-mating opportunities. We analyzed meat sharing events (n = 484) resulting from hunts, along with data on copulations, age-sex class, and kinship to determine which variables predict the likelihood of meat sharing during this study period (2006-2019).Results: We found full or partial support for kin selection, direct reciprocity, and meat-for-mating-opportunities. However, the analyses reveal that reciprocity and a mother/offspring relationship were the strongest predictors of whether or not an individual shared meat.Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the complexity of chimpanzee meat sharing behaviors, especially at a site where social tolerance offers increased opportunities for meat sharing by individuals other than dominant males. These findings can be placed in a referential model to inform hypotheses about the sensitivity of food sharing to environmental pressures, such as resource scarcity in savanna landscapes.},

We reconstruct periodicity and duration of rLEH in canine teeth from three recently deceased chimpanzees from Fongoli, Senegal with a marked seven-month dry season. High-resolution dental molds were taken in the field for magnified imaging with digital microscopy. Photomontages allowed counting of perikymata between episodes of rLEH for reconstruction of periodicity and duration of physiological stress. Where rLEH spans the imbricational enamel, the number of events is consistent with years required to form canine imbricational enamel; i.e., periodicity of rLEH seems circannual. We predicted perikymata counts between rLEH events ranging from 52 to 61 based on reported long counts of 76 days. Counts ranged from 29.5 to 44, individual mean of 36.7. This discrepancy could be explained by recurrent stress with a periodicity of 7.28.4 months, or by long counts of 10 days per stria. Neither is supported in the literature. Since we find evidence of rLEH with circannual periodicity, we postulate the existence of non-emergent imbricational striae. Based on evidence that stress at Fongoli recurs annually, we reconstruct stress duration of 23 months, longer than reported for chimpanzees living in other habitats, which we attribute to heat stress and food shortage near shrinking waterholes. We conclude that canine teeth from a small mortality cohort of chimpanzees at Fongoli preserve a faithful record of dry season stress in an extreme environment. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

Reproductive studies were undertaken on field samples from different biotopes and by laboratory breeding experiments. For the three species the litter size at birth in captivity is lower than the number of embryos recorded from pregnant females in the field. The sex-ratio at birth and weaning is not different from 1/1. The other reproductive characteristics can be summarized for each species as follows M. erythroleucus females, after a 21-day gestation period, give birth to 7.1 individuals, 80 \% of which survive to weaning. The mean interval between two successive litters is about 61 days. For M. huberti females, the lengh of the gestation period is about 22 days. The mean litter size is about 6.4 and 72 \% of newborn survive to weaning. Sixty eight days separate two successive litters. M. natalensis females, after a 21-day gestation period, produce about 6.5 young individuals every 53 days and only 50 \% of them survive to weaning. It seems that the larger distribution of M. erythroleucus, compared to the restricted distribution of the other species could be explained by its greater reproductive performances that allow this species to colonize new habitats faster than the other ones.},

The treatment regimen studied can only be recommended in certain herds and further research is needed to identify the factors determining the negative response in other herds.

	abstract = {The multi-disciplinary French project "Adaptation a la Fievre de la Vallee du Rift" (AdaptFVR) has concluded a 10-year constructive interaction between many scientists/partners involved with the Rift Valley fever (RVF) dynamics in Senegal. The three targeted objectives reached were (i) to produce--in near real-time--validated risk maps for parked livestock exposed to RVF mosquitoes/vectors bites; (ii) to assess the impacts on RVF vectors from climate variability at different time-scales including climate change; and (iii) to isolate processes improving local livestock management and animal health. Based on these results, concrete, pro-active adaptive actions were taken on site, which led to the establishment of a RVF early warning system (RVFews). Bulletins were released in a timely fashion during the project, tested and validated in close collaboration with the local populations, i.e. the primary users. Among the strategic, adaptive methods developed, conducted and evaluated in terms of cost/benefit analyses are the larvicide campaigns and the coupled bio-mathematical (hydrological and entomological) model technologies, which are being transferred to the staff of the "Centre de Suivi Ecologique" (CSE) in Dakar during 2013. Based on the results from the AdaptFVR project, other projects with similar conceptual and modelling approaches are currently being implemented, e.g. for urban and rural malaria and dengue in the French Antilles.},

	abstract = {We used a quantitative microbiological risk assessment model to describe the risk of Campylobacter and Salmonella infection linked to chicken meals prepared in households in Dakar, Senegal. The model uses data collected specifically for this study, such as the prevalence and level of bacteria on the neck skin of chickens bought in Dakar markets, time-temperature profiles recorded from purchase to consumption, an observational survey of meal preparation in private kitchens, and detection and enumeration of pathogens on kitchenware and cooks' hands. Thorough heating kills all bacteria present on chicken during cooking, but cross-contamination of cooked chicken or ready-to-eat food prepared for the meal via kitchenware and cooks' hands leads to a high expected frequency of pathogen ingestion. Additionally, significant growth of Salmonella is predicted during food storage at ambient temperature before and after meal preparation. These high exposures lead to a high estimated risk of campylobacteriosis and/or salmonellosis in Dakar households. The public health consequences could be amplified by the high level of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella and Campylobacter observed in this setting. A significant decrease in the number of ingested bacteria and in the risk could be achieved through a reduction of the prevalence of chicken contamination at slaughter, and by the use of simple hygienic measures in the kitchen. There is an urgent need to reinforce the hygiene education of food handlers in Senegal. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

Seventy broiler farms were studied around Dakar from January 2000 to December 2001 around Dakar. A questionnaire was administered to the farmers, and samples of fresh droppings were taken to assess the flocks' Campylobacter status. About 63\% of the flocks were infected by Campylobacter spp.; Campylobacter,jejuni was the most-prevalent species (P {\textless} 0.05). An elevated risk of Campylobacter infection was associated with other animals (mainly laying hens, cattle and sheep) being bred in the farm, the farm staff not wearing their work clothing exclusively in the poultry houses, uncemented poultry-house floors and the use of cartons that transport chicks from the hatchery to the farm as feed plates (rather than specifically designed feed plates). Alternatively, thorough cleaning and disinfection of poultry-house surroundings and manure disposal outside the farm were associated with decreased flock risk. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We sampled different rodent communities within and around human settlements in Northern Senegal, an area subjected to major environmental transformations associated with global changes. Herein, we conducted an epidemiological study on their bacterial communities. One hundred and seventy-one (171) invasive and native rodents were captured, 50 from outdoor trapping sites and 121 rodents from indoor habitats, consisting of five species. The DNA of thirteen pathogens was successfully screened on the rodents' spleens. We found: 2.3\% of spleens positive to Piroplasmida and amplified one which gave a potentially new species Candidatus "Theileria senegalensis"; 9.35\% of Bartonella spp. and amplified 10, giving three genotypes; 3.5\% of filariasis species; 18.12\% of Anaplasmataceae species and amplified only 5, giving a new potential species Candidatus "Ehrlichia senegalensis"; 2.33\% of Hepatozoon spp.; 3.5\% of Kinetoplastidae spp.; and 15.2\% of Borrelia spp. and amplified 8 belonging all to Borrelia crocidurae. Some of the species of pathogens carried by the rodents of our studied area may be unknown because most of those we have identified are new species. In one bacterial taxon, Anaplasma, a positive correlation between host body mass and infection was found. Overall, male and invasive rodents appeared less infected than female and native ones, respectively.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {More than 2000 animals belonging to six different rodent species and one insectivore species were examined for infection with schistosomes in the region of Richard-Toll, Senegal. Two murid rodents, Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, were found infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Prevalences were about 5\% for both rodent species with a mean worm burden of about 20 worms per host. The sex-ratios of S. mansoni worms were always biased towards males. Prevalences and worm burdens, although similar in both male and female rodents, increased significantly with age. The highest prevalences and worm burdens were found near habitations and decreased significantly with the distance from the town of Richard-Toll. Eggs were also observed in the liver and faeces of the two naturally infected rodent species. The results suggest that rodents participate in the transmission of intestinal schistosomiasis in Richard-Toll but the human population is the main source of infection. The genetic resemblance between human and murine isolates of S. mansoni suggests that further epidemiological studies are needed in this region of Senegal.},

Over 3 years, 737 monkeys were captured, aged using anthropometry and dentition, and tested for exposure to CHIKV by detection of neutralizing antibodies. Infant monkeys were positive for CHIKV even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of mosquitoes and when population immunity was too high for monkeys alone to support continuous transmission. We conclude that monkeys in this region serve as amplification hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.},

Thus, SEOV is a possible emerging zoonotic risk in Africa. Moreover, the range of SEOV could rapidly expand, and transmission to humans could increase because of host switching from the usual brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) species, which is currently invading Africa, to the more widely installed black rat (R. rattus) species. Because of rapid economic development, environmental and climatic changes, and increased international trade, strengthened surveillance is urgently needed to prevent SEOV dissemination among humans in Africa.},

The released incomes are related to the marketing of ruminants (97.9\% of the livestock farming income with the bovines contributing for 40\% and small ruminants for 60\%). The sale of dairy by-products (fresh and curdled milk, butter) remain marginal (0.50\%) and are conversely linked to the degree of enclosure of the herders' places of residence and activity. The diversification of production and the activities is not apparent in the activities of selling. The concepts of poverty, vulnerability and supply of basic social services are reconsidered according to the characteristics of pastoralism in arid regions (mobility, families breakdown, spatial dispersion).},

In this population the mortality rate due to coccidiosis reaches 10.8 \%. Coccidiosis was responsible for the death of 2.0 \% of the animal population on the point of laying which represented 18.9 \% of the total mortality and induced a 5.4 egg fall per laying hen, i.e. 2.5 \%. With regards to flocks free from clinical coccidiosis, the consumption index of attacked livestock was 19 \% higher and the culling 12 weeks delayed. Eventually, there was no significant difference between weight of culling hens with and without history of clinical symptoms.},

	abstract = {We studied the nesting behavior of the critically endangered West African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). We assumed that the nesting data stemmed from a single, unhabituated community at the Bagnomba hill site in the savanna-woodlands of southeastern Senegal. The aim of this study was to examine chimpanzees' nesting habits in terms of the tree species utilized and sleeping nest heights. We recorded a total of 550 chimpanzee nests at Bagnomba between January 2015 and December 2015. The chimpanzees here made nests in particular tree species more often than others. The majority of nests (63\%) were in two tree species: Diospyros mespiliformis and Pterocarpus erinaceus. The average height of nesting trees was 10.54 m (SD 3.91, range, 0.0-29.0 m) and average nest height was 7.90 m (SD 3.62, range, 0.0-25.0 m). The result of a linear regression analysis (r = 0.7874; n = 550; p {\textless} 0.05) is consistent with a preference for nesting at a particular height. Bagnomba chimpanzees rarely made ground nests (0.36\% of nests), but the presence of any ground nesting was unexpected, given that at least one leopard (Panthera pardus) also occupied the hill. This knowledge will enable stakeholders involved in the protection of chimpanzees specifically and of biodiversity in general to better understand chimpanzee ecology and inform a conservation action plan in Senegal where the survival of this species is threatened.},

The modification and use of tools during hunting, however, is still considered to be a uniquely human trait among primates. Here, we report the first account of habitual tool use during vertebrate hunting by nonhumans. At the Fongoli site in Senegal, we observed ten different chimpanzees use tools to hunt prosimian prey in 22 bouts. This includes immature chimpanzees and females, members of age-sex classes not normally characterized by extensive hunting behavior. Chimpanzees made 26 different tools, and we were able to recover and analyze 12 of these. Tool construction entailed up to five steps, including trimming the tool tip to a point. Tools were used in the manner of a spear, rather than a probe or rousing tool. This new information on chimpanzee tool use has important implications for the evolution of tool use and construction for hunting in the earliest hominids, especially given our observations that females and immature chimpanzees exhibited this behavior more frequently than adult males.},

We observed habituated chimpanzees on 122 d during 8 mo in 2005 and 2006, employing both focal subject and scan sampling of identified individuals for 1278 h of data collection. Chimpanzees reingested seeds of 2 species: Parkia biglobosa and Adansonia digitata. Both seed species have a hard protective shell, and the embryos are rich in proteins and lipids. Chimpanzees initially ate the fruit matrix pulp and swallowed intact seeds before reingesting and chewing/destroying seeds. Seed reingestion accounted for almost 2\% of feeding time. We suggest that at Fongoli this behavior may be an adaptive strategy to maximize food intake, by softening the seed's shell and making the seed's content more accessible.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease (NTD) affecting both humans and animals. The morbidity and mortality inflicted upon livestock in sub-Saharan Africa has been largely overlooked, in part due to a lack of validated sensitive and specific tests, which do not require specialist training or equipment to deliver and interpret. Inexpensive, noninvasive, and sensitive diagnostic tests for livestock-use would also facilitate both prevalence mapping and appropriate intervention programmes. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the currently available point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (POC-CCA), designed for Schistosoma mansoni detection in humans, for the detection of intestinal livestock schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. POC-CCA, together with the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) test, miracidial hatching technique (MHT) and organ and mesentery inspection (for animals from abattoirs only), were applied to samples collected from 195 animals (56 cattle and 139 small ruminants (goats and sheep) from abattoirs and living populations) from Senegal. POC-CCA sensitivity varied by ruminant group and by location/parasite species: sensitivity was greater in Barkedji (cattle: mean 81\% (95\% credible interval (CrI): 55\%-98\%); small ruminants: 49\% (29\%-87\%), where livestock were primarily infected by S. curassoni, than in Richard Toll (cattle: 62\% (41\%-84\%); small ruminants: 12\% (1\%-37\%), where S. bovis was the main parasite species. Mean POC-CCA specificity across sites in small ruminants was 91\% (77\%-99\%) with little variation between locations/parasites (Barkedji: 91\% (73\%-99\%); Richard Toll: 88\% (65\% - 99\%). Specificity could not be assessed in cattle owing to the low number of uninfected cattle surveyed. Overall, our results indicate that, whilst the current POC-CCA does represent a potential diagnostic tool for animal schistosomiasis, future work is needed to develop a livestock-specific affordable and field-applicable diagnostic tests to enable determination of the true extent of livestock schistosomiasis.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The AHSV antigen used for coating was semipurified according to the method of Manning and Chen (Curr. Microbiol. 4:381, 1980); control mock- infected Vero cell antigen was treated in the same manner. A total of 459 horse serum samples were assayed at a single dilution (1:10), and their reactivities were compared with those of reference positive anti-AHSV and reference negative horse sera. A total of 81\% of the horse serum samples clearly contained antibodies against AHSV; this consisted of 18\% (of the total number of serum samples) strongly positive, 46.5\% moderately positive, and 16.5\% weakly but still clearly positive. Such results suggest a high prevalence of AHSV in the regions from whence the samples originated. Reports from investigations in other countries in this area of West Africa have also shown a high prevalence for anti-AHSV antibodies in equids. The question is raised as to how the animals became seropositive and whether the observations represent an increased resistance of horses living in a region in which AHS is enzootic.},

Out of a total of 283 animal sera collected, CCHF-specific antibodies were identified in 92 (32.5\%; confidence interval [CI]95\% 27.1-38.3) sera by double antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The prevalence of CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection among horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, donkeys, and goats was 70.3\% (45/64), 57.1\% (8/14), 22.1\% (30/136), 18.2\% (2/11), 17.2\% (5/29), and 6.9\% (2/29), respectively. The antibody titers were found significantly affected by age (p {\textless} 0.0001) and gender (p {\textless} 0.05). High tick infestation by Rhipicephalus spp. and Hyalomma spp. was recorded on horses. The high seroprevalence to CCHFV among animals in the northern region of Senegal observed in this study indicates the permanent presence of the infection in the northern region of the country suggesting the need to strengthen surveillance plans for CCHF in Senegal.},

Whether sex differences exist in building, as in extractive foraging, is unknown, and little is known about how building skills develop and vary between individuals in the wild. We therefore aimed to describe the nesting behavior of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Fongoli, Senegal to provide comparative data and to investigate possible sex or age differences in nest building behaviors and nest characteristics. We followed chimpanzee groups to their night nesting sites to record group (55 nights) and individual level data (17 individuals) on nest building initiation and duration (57 nests) during the dry season between October 2007 and March 2008. We returned the following morning to record nest and tree characteristics (71 nests built by 25 individuals). Fongoli chimpanzees nested later than reported for other great apes, but no sex differences in initiating building emerged. Observations were limited but suggest adult females and immature males to nest higher, in larger trees than adult males, and adult females to take longer to build than either adult or immature males. Smaller females and immature males may avoid predation or access thinner, malleable branches, by nesting higher than adult males. These differences suggest that sex differences described for chimpanzee tool use may extend to nest building, with females investing more time and effort in constructing a safe, warm structure for sleep than males do.},

	abstract = {There is little detailed documentation of immature behavior, especially mother-offspring interactions, for nocturnal prosimians, and few studies have examined sex differences in mother-offspring interactions. This study compares the behavior of captive-born Galago senegalensis braccatus, the Senegal galago, from 1 to 20 weeks of age for 3-5 females and 4-6 males. The subjects lived in social groups, onfa reversed light cycle. Three 10-min focal samples were taken each week, for each subject, during each of the 6 most active hours of the waking cycle (night). Locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing analysis was used to test for sex differences in behavior. There were no sex differences in most forms of mother-offspring contact, including nursing, control of proximity with the mother or grooming. Females were more active than males in the rate of solitary acrobatic play and, only after the age of weaning, in locomotion. Altogether, these observations suggest that the sexes might not present more energetic 'costs' to mothers. There were tendencies for female immatures to play with the mother more than male immatures did, and a tendency for the males to investigate the cage more than the females. Male and female immatures groomed non-mother group mates in equivalent amounts. Since males are likely the dispersing sex in galagos, these differences might be reflective of later dispersal patterns. However, comparisons are needed with a female dispersal species (e.g. chimpanzees) to test this hypothesis. Alternative hypotheses concerning the 'cost' and/or'value' of sons versus daughters need to be explored. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

	abstract = {Urbanization processes are taking place at a very high rate, especially in Africa. At the same time, a number of small mammal species, be they native or invasive, take advantage of human-induced habitat modifications. They represent commensal communities of organisms that cause a number of inconveniences to humans, including potential reservoirs of zoonotic diseases. We studied via live trapping and habitat characterization such commensal small mammal communities in small villages to large cities of Senegal, to try to understand how the species share this particular space. Seven major species were recorded, with exotic invasive house mice (Mus musculus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) dominating in numbers. The shrew Crocidura olivieri appeared as the main and more widespread native species, while native rodent species (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni) were less abundant and/or more localized. Habitat preferences, compared between species in terms of room types and characteristics, showed differences among house mice, black rats and M. natalensis especially. Niche (habitat component) breadth and overlap were measured. Among invasive species, the house mouse showed a larger niche breadth than the black rat, and overall, all species displayed high overlap values. Co-occurrence patterns were studied at the global and local scales. The latter show cases of aggregation (between the black rat and native species, for instance) and of segregation (as between the house mouse and the black rat in Tambacounda, or between the black rat and M. natalensis in Kedougou). While updating information on commensal small mammal distribution in Senegal, a country submitted to a dynamic process of invasion by the black rat and the house mouse, we bring original information on how species occupy and share the commensal space, and make predictions on the evolution of these communities in a period of ever-accelerating global changes. We present and analyse data on the distribution of commensal small mammals obtained via intensive trapping operation and habitat description in a series of localities in Senegal, with the aim to: (i) describe the community of small mammals living in contact with humans and evaluate the respective share that native and invasive species occupy with this community; (ii) better understand the factors that govern species distribution and co-occurrence of species using a series of analyses using habitat characteristics gathered at the moment of captures, in view of a better understanding of patterns and processes at work in a group of organisms of particular concern regarding their interactions with humans.image},

Rice production has increased due to the development of vast irrigated perimeters, which has been accompanied by recurrent proliferations of rodent populations that are crop pests and reservoirs of zoonoses. The aim of our study was to determine the factors underlying these phases of increased rodent abundance over a ten-year (2008 to 2019) sampling period during the hot dry season (February-May). A total of 1,867 rodents of four species were captured, among which Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti dominated. Our results showed that, during this season, rodent abundance (i) increases significantly with rainfall from the previous year, (ii) is higher in cultivated than in uncultivated plots, (iii) increases with plant cover, (iv) increases, for M. huberti, with the presence of open water. We showed that in an area that was first sparsely cultivated and then impacted by hydro-agricultural rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, the abundance of A. niloticus changed following this program, reaching the level of a nearby area that has been intensively cultivated for decades. Moreover, we showed that the proportion of adults among the captured individuals was lower in rice plots than in vegetable gardening fields and uncultivated plots. The breeding pattern of adult individuals was also affected by land use. Results suggest that uncultivated areas and vegetable gardening fields constitute refuge and breeding ground hotspots and would thus form a starting point for the invasion of rice fields. Following these results, we advocate for regular monitoring of rodent breeding and abundance patterns, with a special focus on these refuge areas, particularly during the hot dry season. We recommend implementing effective and sustainable science-based control strategies at national and community levels to keep rodent populations within tolerable limits.},

Most of the dog population is of local and young (average age 29 months). Males are preferred over females. The dogs belong to youths or adolescents who are without means and can neither feed the dogs correctly nor look after them when they fall sick. This individual poverty explains why the dogs are not vaccinated and why they scavenge for survival, thus contacting permanent strays, walking real reservoirs of rabies virus!

Bayesian spatial regression models were developed with interpolated seasonal rainfall, land surface temperature, distance to perennial water bodies, and time of year entered as fixed-effect variables. Average total monthly rainfall during December-February was the most important spatial predictor of risk of positive RVF serologic status. Maps derived from the models highlighted the lower Senegal River basin and the southern border regions of Senegal as high-risk areas.

Findings highlighted that the WDE population has potential to expand in the NKNP, due to an underutilized capacity.

The year was split into 24- and 15-day phases.

Given an initial vector x(1), annual dynamics were described by x(25) = B-24 ... B(1)x(1) = Ax(1), where A was the annual projection matrix. A steady-state hypothesis was used to estimate offtake gains and financial returns from a trial of pasteurellosis vaccination and anthelminthic drench in traditionally managed sheep flocks in Senegal, from July 1987 to June 1988. Nineteen villages and 76 herds were involved in the experiment. Villages were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment combinations in a factorial design, and subsequent demographic rates and net offtake patterns were measured. in the trial, vaccination had a negative effect on offtakes among females. No vaccination effect was observed for males. A positive effect of deworming was found for both sexes. From the trial data, our model calculated that the overall ratio of offtakes (i.e. number of animals) for dewormed over undrenched sheep was 1.2 (95\% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.4).

Tools involved in the development of family poultry range from sensitisation of village groups and organisation of women in poultry groups to training of village vaccinators, farmer field schools for poor illiterate women, organisation of local vendors, use of private veterinarians, and not least involvement of national research, education and extension institutions and international organisations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greater cane rat (GCR), reputed to be African's second largest rodent, is a precocial hystricomorph with an uncommon phenotype and life history. Scientific and socio-economic interests in the GCR have led to heightened research efforts targeted towards a better understanding of its biology and exploration of its economic and translational usefulness. METHOD(S): Records of all online scientific publications on the GCR from Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, science.gov, Ebscohost and Worldwide science, with the exception of research theses, proceedings, unpublished projects and abstracts, were collated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULT(S): A total of 146 published scholarly articles spanning about six decades were retrieved, with 98\% of the GCR publications originating from African countries. Nigeria boasts the highest number of publications (58.22\%) followed by Ghana (21.23\%) and South Africa (5.48\%) while Senegal contributed the least (0.69\%). Publications were sorted into ten field categories. The field with the highest number of articles (41.78\%) was animal breeding and management recording, closely followed by anatomy (37.67\%). Lesser contributions were made by parasitology (5.48\%), biochemistry/hematology (4.8\%), pharmacology/toxicology (4.11\%), pathology (2.06\%), and surgery/anesthesia and physiology (1.37\% apiece). The fields with fewest contributions were microbiology and developmental biology (0.69\% each). CONCLUSION(S): This study chronicles the spectrum of knowledge available on the GCR, highlighting the knowledge gap that still exists in various fields in order to provide advocacy for new frontiers in research efforts on this rodent. We suggest the need for a clearly defined and well integrated national/regional policy aimed at establishing Africa's foremost micro-livestock rodent, the greater cane rat, on the world's scientific radar.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Surveys were carried out between June 2011 and September 2012 in four different areas: Dakar, Sine Saloum, Kedougou region and Basse Casamance in several animal species: dogs (152), donkeys (23), horses (63), sheep (43), goats (52) and cattle (104), distributed in the four sites. Molecular tools (PCR) indicated 3.4\% positive animals including dogs, donkeys, a goat and cattle. The savannah type of Trypanosoma congolense Broden, 1904 (53\% of positive cases) and the forest type of T. congolense (subgenus Nannomonas Hoare, 1964) were predominant. Trypanosoma vivax Ziemann, 1905 (subgenus Duttonella Chalmers, 1918) was only present in one animal and no trypanosome of the subgenus Trypanozoon Luhe, 1906 was found. Half of the positive cases were detected in Sine Saloum, where T. congolense savannah-type was predominant, and the other half in Basse Casamance, where T. congolense forest-type was predominant; no cases were found in Dakar or in the Kedougou region. A high risk of infection in dogs with T. congolense savannah-type was shown in Sine Saloum, requiring prevention and control of dogs in this area. The involvement of tsetse flies in the transmission of T. congolense in Sine Saloum and Basse Casamance is discussed.},

	abstract = {While West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) were elevated to Critically Endangered status by the IUCN in 2016 as a result of significant population declines in recent decades, little is known about the population in Senegal. We surveyed the West African chimpanzees outside protected areas in the Kedougou region of southeastern Senegal between November 2014 and July 2015 using recce walks (n = 57, totalling 300 km of pedestrian survey distance) in potential chimpanzee habitats. We recorded direct observations of chimpanzees or indices of chimpanzee activity, such as sleeping nests, footprints and faeces. We accumulated 21 direct contacts with chimpanzees and recorded 3489 chimpanzee nests. We mapped the distribution of chimpanzee sleeping sites and indicators of anthropogenic activity by regional administrative units to facilitate species management and conservation planning in the immediate future. In addition, we identified the habitats and tree species used by chimpanzees to construct their nests in order to explore nesting tree preferences. Chimpanzees used almost 40 tree species in the Kedougou region but 84\% of nests were associated with eight tree species, namely Pterocarpus erinaceus. Diospyros mespiliformis, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Hexalobus monopetalus, Cola cordifolia, Lannea sp., Parkia biglobosa and Piliostigma thonningii. Among these eight nesting tree species, 60\% of the corresponding nests were located in three species: P. erinaceus, D. mespiliformis and A. leiocarpus. Chimpanzees nested more often in woodland habitat than in gallery forests, although the latter accounts for only a small percentage of available habitat. This study is the most geographically extensive survey of chimpanzees in Senegal to date, broadening our knowledge of the species' northwestern-most distribution in West Africa.},

In addition to the Assirik area of the Parc National du Niokolo Koba (PNNK), areas south and east of the park were surveyed. Nests made by chimpanzees were used to estimate chimpanzee distribution and densities. Within the PNNK, chimpanzees were estimated to occur at an average of 0.13 individuals/km(2). Chimpanzee nests were recorded in nine of 10 locales surveyed outside of. the PNNK, as well as within the park. Data on 994 nests made by chimpanzees were recorded outside the PNNK, while 736 nests were recorded inside the park. Nest density in areas surveyed outside the PNNK, such as Bandafassi, Tomboronkoto, and Segou, was comparable to that of Assirik in habitats where nests were concentrated (i.e., evergreen gallery forest). The purpose of MAPP was to initiate long-term research of chimpanzees in southeastern Senegal, as a follow-up to the Stirling African Primate Project (SAPP) of the 1970s. We sought to replicate the standards set by the SAPP project, except when technological innovations allowed improvement in data collection procedures (e.g., the global positioning system (GPS)).

	abstract = {Little is known about the time-to-first detection and the time difference (TD) between first parasitological and first serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma spp. infections under natural infection challenge in cattle. The objective of our study was to estimate these measures of "longitudinal aspects" of diagnostic performance and to investigate potential biological factors. Emphasis was on diagnosis at the genus level (Trypanosoma spp.). Twelve N'Dama, 12 Gobra zebu and 12N'DamaxGobra (F1) crossbred cattle (all animals non-infected at the start of the experiment, six male and six female animals in each cohort) were exposed to natural high tsetse challenge in the Niamina East area in The Gambia [Acta Trop. 71 (1998) 57]. The animals were investigated parasitologically (detection of trypanosomes by buffy-coat technique), serologically (detection of T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and clinically (packed-cell volume, PCV) over a period of 180 days. The time-to-first detection of trypanosomes, trypanosomal antigen (cut-off as suggested by test supplier) and drop in PCV (subject-based cut-off values) were recorded as outcomes of interest. Thus, incidence was both parasitologically (I(p)), serologically (I(s)) and clinically (I(c)). Recurrent events were not considered. The TD between first parasitological and first serological detection was established as I(s) time minus I(p) time. The effect of breed and sex on the time-to-first detection and on TD was investigated using Cox (proportional hazard) regression and ANOVA, respectively. We found that time-to-first parasitological detection of trypanosomosis in N'Dama animals was significantly longer than in the two other breeds (Cox regression, P=0.002). A similar but less-strong (P=0.063) effect of breed on time-to-first detection of trypanosomal antigen was found, whereas no breed effect was observed for clinical detection (P=0.432). Sex had no effect in all detection systems. The TD varied between -56 and 115 (mean 28). Marked differences among breeds and between sexes were not observed (ANOVA, P=0.8). We suggest that incidence studies are more suitable for detecting risk factors for animal trypanosomosis than prevalence-based (cross-sectional) studies because the latter often result in misinterpretation of factors that increase the survival time with infection as risk factors.},

	volume = {85},
	issn = {0304-4017},
	abstract = {Forty two Djallonke and 27 Djallonke-Sahelian crossbred sheep were compared during 34 weeks for their disease resistance and productivity in a multifactorial experiment including trypanosome infection, helminth infections and dietary level. Eight treatment combinations were formed in which the two breeds were balanced. Pyrexia was observed following trypanosome infection and was not different between the two breeds. However, a significant higher parasitaemia level, a shorter prepatent period and a lower antibody response in the crossbreds following infection, indicated a significant reduction of the trypanotolerance and confirmed the genetic origin of the trait. Neither helminth infection nor dietary level influenced the onset and level of parasitaemia or the level of antibody response following trypanosome infection. Trypanosome infection, helminth infection and low supplementary feeding caused independently significant reductions in PCV level and weight gain but these declines were not worse in crossbreds as compared to Djallonke. Independently, of the studied factors, crossbreds were generally heavier than Djallonke and also grew faster, especially during the second phase of the study. Crossbreds had significantly higher mean nematode egg output (epg) compared to Djallonke sheep but reduction of epg following deworming was similar in both breeds. The lower epg in the Djallonke breed indicated an innate resistance to helminths and/or more efficient immune response. Trypanosome infection tended to increase epg, confirming the immunosuppressive effect of the former. The higher body temperature in the Djallonke compared to crossbreds suggested a better heat tolerance in the former breed. From this study it was concluded that Djallonke-Sahelian crossbred sheep inspite of a reduced trypanotolerance and lower resistance to helminth infection, posses a higher potential to intensify mutton production as compared to the pure Djallonke. However, appropriate measures should be taken to limit disease and stress factors in order to optimise production environment for this crossbred sheep.},

	issn = {0304-4017},
	abstract = {Susceptibility to Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax challenge and cross species-superchallenges, and related effects on health and productivity were assessed in N'Dama cattle. Twenty-five N'Dama bulls aged 3-4 years and previously primed with trypanosome infections through natural tsetse exposure over more than one year were used. The experimental herd was divided in five groups each composed of five randomly selected animals. Group 1 was challenged with T. congolense, Group 2 with T. vivax, Group 3 was inoculated with T. congolense followed by a cross-superchallenge with T. vivax, Group 4 was inoculated with T. vivax followed by T. congolense cross-superchallenge. Animals in Group 5 were used as controls. Both T. vivax and T. congolense cross-superchallenges were carried out on Day 14 subsequent to respective initial T. congolense and T. vivax inoculations. All challenges were performed by intradermal needle inoculation of stocks of trypanosome bloodstream forms. In challenged animals (Group 1 to 4), parasitaemia profiles and packed red cell volumes (PCV) were measured for four months. Weight changes were recorded monthly and daily weight gain (DWG) computed. All cattle challenged with T. congolense became parasitaemic. Conversely, one animal in Group 2 and two in Group 3 never displayed patent T. vivax parasitaemia. Both in single (Group 1), initial (Group 3) and cross-superchallenged (Group 4) cattle higher percentage of positive blood samples and higher parasitaemia level were obtained following T. congolense than T. vivax inocula (Group 2, 3 and 4) (P{\textless}0.04 or greater). Overall the pre-challenge period, PCV values and DWGs were nearly identical in the five groups. Conversely, over the post-challenge period, cattle singly, initially and cross-superinoculated with T. congolense (Group 1, 3 and 4) displayed lower PCV values and DWGs in comparison with both control animals (Group 5) and with singly T. vivax challenged cattle (Group 2) (P{\textless}0.05 or greater). No difference in mean PCV levels and DWGs was found between animals in Group 2 and cattle in Group 5. It was concluded that trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle suffered more from T. congolense and mixed T. congolensel T. vivax infections, while pure T. vivax infection did not produce appreciable negative effects on their health and productivity. Therefore, considering that tsetse and trypanosomosis control campaigns are costly and are justified only when derived economic benefits exceed those of control, and also that an ample mosaic of farming systems exists in West Africa, species-specific trypanosome prevalence and relative impact should be assessed in various cattle populations and breeds differing in trypanosome susceptibility before advising any intervention. Moreover, virulence and related effects of T. congolense and T. vivax endemic stocks on health and productivity in local cattle populations should also be estimated in order to counsel appropriate economic protection measures against trypanosmosis, i.e. vector control and/or strategic use of trypanocidal drugs.},

The level of anaemia caused by the trypanosome infection was similar in the two breeds during the trial. Based on these findings, no difference in tolerance or susceptibility to T. congolense could be demonstrated between the WAD goats and their Saanen crosses. Although the weight of all goats increased during the trial, the crosses gained significantly more weight than the WAD goats. The trypanosome infection reduced the growth rate of both breeds, but this reduction was not statistically significant.

	abstract = {The use of trypanotolerant livestock is considered to be an important strategy for the control of African animal trypanosomiasis. In order to define the extent of the differences in susceptibility and productivity, 10 Zebu cows (a breed considered trypanosusceptible) and 10 N'Dama cows (a breed recognised for trypanotolerance) were exposed to a natural field challenge from Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead. The animals were two-and-a-half to three years old and had not been previously exposed to trypanosomiasis. All Zebu died of trypanosomiasis within eight months of first exposure. In contrast, only three N'Dama died of trypanosomiasis; they had all been suckling calves before they succumbed 11 to 14 months after initial exposure. The prevalence, level and duration of parasitaemia were significantly less in the N'Dama, which, unlike the Zebu, did not become febrile during parasitaemia. The differences in parasitaemia were largely attributable to Trypanosoma vivax. The N'Dama also developed much less severe anaemia than the Zebu. The mean and standard deviation of the packed red cell volume of the N'Dama was not significantly different between eight months after exposure when all Zebu were dead, and 21 months when the experiment was terminated. The relative productivity of the N'Dama was impressive. In addition to reduced mortality, the N'Dama experienced no abortions and produced five calves, three of which were alive at the end of the experiment, at which time three of the surviving N'Dama were pregnant. In the Zebu, in marked contrast, abortions occurred both in early and late pregnancy and no live calves were produced. The study confirmed that N'Dama cattle are innately less susceptible to trypanosomiasis than Zebu cattle and can survive and be productive in endemic areas of trypanosomiasis where Zebu perish.},

A previous study of handedness for termite fishing reported population-level left handedness in the chimpanzees from Gombe National Park, Tanzania. In the current study, we examined whether similar hand preferences were evident in a savanna-dwelling chimpanzee population with regards to termite fishing. Hand preference data were collected for 27 chimpanzees from February 2007 through July 2008 and November 2011 through January 2012 in southeastern Senegal. Overall, the Fongoli chimpanzees demonstrate a trend toward population-level handedness, though the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance likely due to the limited sample size. Fongoli chimpanzees showed the same pattern of left hand preference as reported at Gombe and the two populations did not differ significantly. When the data were combined across all studies, wild chimpanzees showed a population-level left hand preference for termite fishing. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It answers for this specific region the question of whether present-day situations of close chimpanzee-human spatial proximity are stable or only temporary phenomena in long-term processes of environmental change, and shows that conservation policies centred on either of these two "flagship" species carry radically different ecological, political and territorial implications. The second part shifts to local-level perspectives on human-chimpanzee relationships, emphasizing the land rights contentions and misunderstandings created by the implementation of protected areas at Bossou and in the Bok, region of Guinea. These case studies help to look at acts of resistance and local interpretations of primate conservation policies as opportunities to reconsider what is being protected, for what purpose, as whose heritage, and to move towards new and more legitimate opportunities for the implementation of conservation policies.},

	abstract = {Background: Bartonella is the monotypic genus of the family Bartonellaceae, Alpha-proteobacteria. TMany Bartonella species are associated with human diseases. Rodent-associated species, such as B. elizabethae, B. grahamii and B. vinsonii are human pathogens. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents from Senegal were carried out and the only West African country where it was performed is Nigeria. Methods \& Materials: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents in Sine-Saloum region of Senegal where rodents and are reservoirs rodent-associated soft ticks are vectors of relapsing fever caused by Borrelia crocidurae. Rodents and insectivores were captured alive in February 2013 in two sites (Dielmo and Ndiop) using wire mesh traps baited with peanut butter or onions. Trapped rodents and insectivores were anaesthetized and opened in sterile conditions. Blood was inoculated on Columbia agar plates (5\% sheep blood). The gltA, rpoB, 16S rRNA, ftsZ genes and ITS were amplified and sequenced from recovered Bartonella isolates. Result(s): In total, during the period of 6 days 119 small mammals were captured: 116 rodents and 3 shrews (Crocidura cf. olivieri). Rodents were identified morphologically: 5 Arvicantis niloticus, 56 Gerbilliscus gambianus, 49 Mastomys erythroleucus, 5 Mus musculus and 1 Praomys daltoni. 30 isolates of Bartonella spp. were recovered from the blood of rodents. None of the isolated belonged to already described species of Bartonella. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolated bartonellae form three separate clusters within the genus Bartonella. Comparison of gltA genes of recovered isolated with those of officially recognized species allowed to conclude that three clusters may present three separate new species of Bartonella. Candidatus "Bartonella raoultii" (1 isolate) and Candidatus "Bartonella mastomydis" (21 isolates) were recovered only from Mastomys erythroleucus, Candidatus "Bartonella saheliensis" (8 isolates) were recovered only from Gerbilliscus gambianus. Conclusion(s): Rodents in Senegal are not only reservoirs of the agent of relapsing fever, but also of three new Bartonella species. The pathogenicity for humans of these isolates is yet to be investigated. Unlike other African countries, each genetic cluster of bartonellae from Senegalese rodents is associated with a specific rodent species.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the traditional breeding objectives and practices of West African Dwarf goat, Djallonke sheep, and N'dama cattle keepers in The Gambia and discusses the implications of these on the design of breeding-related interventions to improve livestock productivity. Data were collected via surveys implemented within three study sites in The Gambia, where traditional mixed crop-livestock smallholder farming predominates. The surveys comprised a participatory rural appraisal conducted in nine communities and a household questionnaire targeting 238 households. Livestock-keeping households were classified as 'poorer' or 'wealthier' based on the number of cattle owned. The most important objectives for keeping all species of livestock for the poorer groups (0 to 10 cattle) was 'savings and insurance', followed by 'income' and 'ceremonial/dowry' for the small ruminants and 'manure' and 'draught' for both cows and bulls. In contrast, for the wealthier group (more than 10 cattle), savings and insurance was the fourth to seventh ranked production objective (depending on species), with the most important production objectives being ceremonial/dowry for goats, income for sheep and manure for cows and bulls. An analysis of breeding practices indicated that breeding animals are selected on criteria which partially align to the breeding objectives, animals are rarely purchased for the purpose of breed improvement, knowledge of the cause and consequence of inbreeding is low and breeding decision makers may not necessarily be the livestock owner, particularly if the livestock owner is a women. Given this, it is suggested that capacity building on breeding-related issues, particularly in relation to the selection of breeding animals and specifically targeted at the different socioeconomic groups of livestock keepers, may be an appropriate, effective and relatively low-cost breeding intervention.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A 2-year-old female crossbred Belgian shepherd dog was presented for exhaustion and weight loss. Severe hypoglycaemia (0.12 g/l), anaemia (red blood cells 2.6 x 1012/l) and thrombocytopenia (45 x 109/ l) were diagnosed. The dog had just returned from a 6 month stay in Senegal and sub-Saharan Africa. A diagnosis of canine African trypanosomiasis was made. Material(s) and Method(s): Examination of blood smears, lymph node aspiration and PCR on whole blood. Result(s): Blood smears showed red blood cell anisocytosis and polychromasia, macrothrombocytes and numerous free protozoa were also recognized. The parasites were 10-20 mm in length, had a central nucleus, a medium-sized kinetoplast located at the margin of the body, just in front of the posterior extremity (marginal and subterminal kinetoplast), a poorly-developed undulating membrane and no free flagellum. This morphology is consistent with Trypanosoma congolense. Numerous trypanosomes were also present in the lymph node aspirate. PCR analysis revealed an infection with Trypanosoma congolense forest-type. Conclusion(s): The dog was chronically infected by Trypanosoma congolense forest-type. In cattle, strains of T. congolense differ greatly in virulence: T. congolense savannah-type produces rapidly fatal infection, T. congolense forest-type causes chronic infection and T. congolense kilifi-type produces inapparent infection.},

	abstract = {African animal trypanosomiasis, or Nagana, is a debilitating and economically costly disease with a major impact on animal health in sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosoma vivax, one of the principal trypanosome species responsible for the disease, infects a wide host range including cattle, goats, horses and donkeys and is transmitted both cyclically by tsetse flies and mechanically by other biting flies, resulting in a distribution covering large swathes of South America and much of sub-Saharan Africa. While there is evidence for mating in some of the related trypanosome species, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma cruzi, very little work has been carried out to examine this question in T. vivax. Understanding whether mating occurs in T. vivax will provide insight into the dynamics of trait inheritance, for example the spread of drug resistance, as well as examining the origins of meiosis in the order Kinetoplastida. With this in mind we have identified orthologues of eight core meiotic genes within the genome, the presence of which imply that the potential for mating exists in this species. In order to address whether mating occurs, we have investigated a sympatric field population of T. vivax collected from livestock in The Gambia, using microsatellite markers developed for this species. Our analysis has identified a clonal population structure showing significant linkage disequilibrium, homozygote deficits and disagreement with Hardy-Weinberg predictions at six microsatellite loci, indicative of a lack of mating in this population of T. vivax.},

	abstract = {Susceptibility to trypanosome infections and tick infestations was assessed in 51 N'Dama, 48 Gobra zebu and 37 Gobra x N'Dama crossbred (F1) cattle exposed to field-tick infestations and natural high tsetse challenge over more than one year. From these cattle, 12 animals of each breed were randomly selected and examined parasitologically for trypanosome infections and packed cell volume (PCV) twice a week (high surveillance, group HS). In the remaining 100 cattle trypanosome infection and PCV were monitored monthly (low surveillance, group LS). Mortality rates were recorded in both groups. Tick infestation was quantified fortnightly from all animals in group HS and from four to seven randomly selected animals of each breed in group LS. In both HS and LS groups, trypanocidal drug treatment was administered to trypanosome positive animals with PCV equal to or less than 20\% or when they showed clinical evidence (dullness, weight loss) of trypanosomosis. In both groups, N'Dama cattle exhibited a superior capacity to control trypanosome infections and limit tick burdens. Particularly, in group HS N'Dama cattle showed lower trypanosome infection rate, higher mean PCV value, lower requirement for trypanocide treatments and lower tick load than crossbred and Gobra cattle in the corresponding group (P {\textless} 0.05 or greater). This was also true in N'Damas in comparison with crossbreds in group LS. Unfortunately, the high mortality occurring in Gobra cattle in group LS did not allow within group comparative analysis between N'Dama, Gobra and crossbred cattle overall the study period. No death occurred in N'Dama cattle maintained under high surveillance of trypanosome infection, while approximately 8\% of crossbreds and 50\% of Gobras died of trypanosomosis. In group LS, all Gobra and more than 70\% of crossbred cattle died. In this group, mortality in N'Dama was limited to less than 16\%. In both groups, differences in mortality were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) in Gobras than in N'Damas. Within breed, animals of the three breeds maintained under high surveillance of trypanosomal infection showed higher mean PCV values, lower tick burdens and required proportionally less trypanocide treatments than corresponding cattle in group LS. The infection rate in N'Dama under high surveillance was lower in comparison with N'Dama cattle in group LS. There was no significant difference in mortality between groups within the N'Dama breed. Conversely, mortality rates were lower in crossbred and Gobra in group HS than in respective cattle in group LS. It was concluded that cattle of the three breeds suffered from trypanosomosis and that trypanosome infections affected tick susceptibility. However, N'Dama showed a superior ability to limit both the pathological effects of trypanosomosis and the level of tick infestations. Therefore, considering the cost of labour and consumable equipment required for a high surveillance, use of multi-disease resistant N'Dama cattle is recommended for the low-input traditional African farming systems in areas where trypanosomosis, ticks and tick-borne diseases are constraints to livestock production. Additional comparative investigations are needed to assess the impact of high surveillance scheme of trypanosome infection in different production systems in trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle exposed to different gradients of tsetse challenge.},

There was a strong correlation between prevalence and incidence of infection in the N'Dama.

There are few reports describing the prevalence or the range of clinical signs associated with infection with different species of trypanosomes in horses and donkeys, but given the importance of these animals, the role of trypanosomosis requires investigation., RESULTS: In total 241 animals from the Central River Division in The Gambia (183 horses and 58 donkeys) were screened using Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) followed by trypanosome species identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results indicated overall trypanosome prevalence of 91\%; with an infection rate of 31\% for Trypanosoma congolense Savannah, 87\% for Trypanosoma vivax and 18\% for Trypanosoma brucei sp. Multiple species were present in 43\% of infections. Microscopy had a good specificity (100\%) and positive predictive value (100\%) for trypanosome detection, but the sensitivity (20\%) and negative predictive value (10.5\%) were low relative to PCR-based diagnosis. Infection with T congolense showed the greatest negative effect on packed cell volume (PCV), while infection with T. brucei sp also had a significant, although lesser, negative effect on PCV. In addition, cases positive by microscopy were associated with significantly lower PCV. However, concurrent infection with T. vivax appeared to cause less effect on PCV, compared to animals infected with T. congolense alone., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Trypanosomosis was high in both horses and donkeys. Infection with T. congolense appeared to have the greatest clinical significance, while T. vivax infection may be of limited clinical significance in this population. Indeed, there is evidence of T. vivax co-infection ameliorating the pathology caused by T. congolense. WGA and PCR allowed a more comprehensive analysis of field infections with the detection of infections below the threshold of microscopy, and provided indications of interactions between parasite species that would otherwise remain undetected. The study raises important questions about the epidemiology of trypanosome infection in relation to disease that require a full scale longitudinal analysis.},

	abstract = {Equine CNS trypanosomosis is a multifocal neurological syndrome of equids which is often fatal. The condition is of international importance with widespread distribution and represents a neglected disease of welfare concern requiring further characterisation. In this study, the clinical, pathological and molecular features of CNS trypanosomosis were investigated using cases presenting in The Gambia. Characterisation of the genotypic variation in the causative T. brucei subspecies (T.b. evansi, or T.b. brucei) was a novel specific aim. Full clinical and neurological examination was performed in working equids presenting with the disease, with detailed pathological and molecular assessment in 6 cases that required euthanasia. Brain and spinal cord specimens (cranial cervical, cervical intumescence, caudal thoracic and lumbosacral) were preserved for evaluation. The severity of specific histopathological changes was scored: perivascular cuffing in the white and grey matter, meningitis, oedema and cellularity in the white and grey matter. DNA extraction and subsequent PCR was performed on CNS samples with standard T. brucei primers and a microsatellite marker panel. T. brucei DNA was present within the CNS of all clinical cases. Histopathology showed diffuse lymphocytic-plasmacytic meningoencephalomyelitis with marked perivascular cuffing. Pathology was most severe in the white matter. Immunohisto- chemistry confirmed T. brucei spp within the CNS tissue sections. Initial microsatellite results indicate at least 4 T. brucei spp. genotypes in the study population, with the same blood and brain populations. Parasitic genotypic variation will be used to assess most likely mode of parasite multiplication, and transmission. This will facilitate the design of international disease control measures for this devastating condition.},

	abstract = {Consistent quantification of trypanosomes, the parasite responsible for African animal trypanosomosis, is important for effective surveillance, control, and eradication strategies. Here, we used a rigorously predefined protocol to search and select eligible publications that utilized either microscopy, serology, or molecular methods to investigate prevalence of trypanosomosis based on the presence of any of three most common Trypanosoma spp. (T. congolense, T. vivax, and T. brucei) in the field-based naturally grazed Gambian cattle, sheep, and goats. To combine results of studies on cattle through meta-analysis, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out with the random effects model, and prevalence estimates of each study with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were presented with a forest plot. All the eligible studies utilized the buffy coat technique (BCT) to detect trypanosomes in the blood samples, while the more sensitive serological and molecular detection methods are yet to be widely exploited. Heterogeneity among the studies on cattle was moderate (I2 = 55\%), and the pooled trypanosomosis prevalence based on the BCT was 5.2\% (95\% CI: 4.0-6.4). Meanwhile, estimated prevalence varied according to the trypanosome detection methods, study locations, types of publication, year, and length of observations. We could not pool the trypanosomosis prevalence in sheep and goats through meta-analysis due to small number of studies. The prevalence estimates based on the BCT ranged from 3.2 to 8.1\% in goats and 2.8 to 10.6\% in sheep. Even though there seems to be a slight decrease in trypanosomosis prevalence in cattle in one of the Gambian districts, there was no consistent trend across the years. It is thought that the literature search and formatting procedures presented in this study contribute to doing systematic reviews on the investigated subject and can be adapted for similar cases.},

	abstract = {Senegal is a country where millions of livelihoods directly depend on smallholder livestock production activities. Unfortunately, these farmers now face the effects of a changing climate and associated societal responses. In addition, the lack of understanding of the specific farmers' problems in their respective production systems by assuming homogeneity has led to inappropriate planning of interventions and inefficient utilization of resources. The variations in individual farming systems and local contexts require to understand each system separately to inform decision-makers and relevant stakeholders about specific entries of intervention for farmers based on customized needs. Using a Fatick region case study, different statistical clustering techniques were adopted to develop a livestock typology that reflects the above realities. This typology confirmed the co-existence of three livestock production cluster systems with differences and similarities in their production targets and quantities, market access, animal breeds, and the livestock management system of the animals. The studied region represented a new format of smallholder livestock development, where the implementation of a dairy processor and its milk collection centre created a new dynamic in production activities. Farmers confirmed that the extension services and a consistent market opportunity provided by the dairy processor increased local productivity and offered an alternative source of income but they have also reiterated concerns like the dairy processor's low milk buying prices which need to be addressed. To harness the growth and the regional opportunities, there is a need to establish robust and continuous collaboration structures between the Government, agro-industries, and producers. These public-private partnerships will help producers lower the cost of inputs and services and increase productivity while boosting local dairy production.},

One knowledge system is a scientific one, the 'new rangeland paradigm'. According to this, pastoral mobility is a means to balance variability in dryland resources; hence, 'nature' is the point of departure. Another knowledge system is local pastoral knowledge. For the pastoralists, the well-being of their animals is the point of departure and mobility is used to ensure that the livestock are in good condition. The paper shows that it is important to distinguish between mobility of pastoralists and of their herd; even though the pastoralists of northern Senegal have become semi-sedentary, their herds are still quite mobile. The pastoralists are willing to move around within a small territory, which they consider their place, but are unwilling to employ large-scale mobility themselves. Mobility is not of importance for their ethnic identity and some use paid herders to care for their livestock. By looking at both knowledge systems, we achieve a better understanding of pastoral mobility and how this may change in the future.},

	volume = {101},
	issn = {0037-9085},
	abstract = {Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and West Nile fever (WN) viruses are transmitted by several mosquito species and share the same vectors in Northern Senegal (West Africa). In absence of an effective treatment and vaccines, vector control remains an alternative method of prevention and control of these vector-borne diseases. The methods targeting adults' pest mosquitoes and malaria vectors which are currently used by the population in the Barkedji area (insecticides treated nets, bombs and copper coil) would not be effective against these vectors because of their exophagic and zoophilic behavior. Thus, we decided to evaluate the effectiveness of insecticide-treated cattle as a method to control these vectors. We evaluated the effects of this treatment on the mortality and the behaviour (attractiveness and engorgement) of the main vectors and subsidiary the whole mosquito fauna. Our study was conducted during September 2005, and between July and November 2006, at Niakha pond located 4 km from the Barkedji village in the Sahelian region of Senegal. A bull-calf was treated with 25 mg/m2 of deltamethrin and compared to an untreated calf of the same weight used as a control. The assays were conducted using two net-traps placed at the edge of the pond from 19:00 PM to 22:00 PM each night for 4 nights per week for 4 consecutive weeks after each treatment. The risk that host- seeking mosquitoes that do not have possibility to feed on cattle might turn to men cohabiting with these cattle was evaluated simultaneously during the bioassay. The deltamethrin treatment led to a significant reduction in the average number of mosquitoes attracted by the treated-calf compared to the control during the first 2 weeks post-treatment both for all species and for the main vectors such as Ae. vexans, Ae. ochraceus, Cx. poicilipes, Cx. neavei and Ma. uniformis. However these means were comparable for the last two weeks post-treatment both for the whole mosquito fauna and the main vectors with the exception of Cx. neavei. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rates of engorged females during the first two weeks post-treatment. Indeed, the females' engorgement rate on the treated-calf compared to the control has been reduced by 57.3\% for Ae. vexans, 39.8\% for Ae. ochraceus, 76.4\% for Cx. poicilipes, 82.4\% for Cx. neavei, 84.6\% for Ma. uniformis and 64.1\% for the whole mosquito fauna. This effect of the treatment was maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment only for Cx. neavei. Mortality rates were higher among mosquitoes collected with the treated-calf compared to the control in the first fortnight of the test. This impact of the insecticide has been maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment excepted for Cx. neavei. However a significant variation of the mortality of the mosquitoes collected with the treated-cattle was observed between the two fortnights. In fact, the mortality rate of the mosquitoes collected on the treated-cattle decreased by 43.8\% for the mosquito fauna as a whole, 47.5\% for Cx. poicilipes and 82.4\% for Ae. vexans, 76\% for Ae. ochraceus, and 63.3\% for Ma. uniformis. No deviation of host-seeking mosquitoes, from treated calf to men, has been observed since the average number of host-seeking mosquitoes collected on men close to the two calves was statistically comparable. The insecticide-treated cattle may be a good method for controlling RVF and WN vectors and associated mosquitoes in Senegal. However there is a need to develop new formulations or new strategies of application that could improve the duration of the effectiveness of the treatment.},

	abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV) is a Culex-associated mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of USUV involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: AF013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to USUV in both Africa and Europe.},

The response of the chickens to the vaccine virus was monitored with the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Pre-vaccination HI tests showed that the majority of chickens tested did not have antibodies to NDV. At 4 and 12 weeks post-vaccination, vaccinated chickens showed 30 and 48\% seroconversion, respectively. The HI titres were indicative of protection, but challenge experiments were not undertaken. Only a low percentage of the control groups were antibody positive at these times.},

	abstract = {We studied patterns of variation in cestode communities of 3 abundant rodent species that live in sympatry in the Niayes of the Retba Lake, Western Senegal. We evaluated whether the host species have the same parasites and, within host species, whether the variability in parasite community is related to intrinsic (sex, age of the host individual) or extrinsic (habitat, season) factors. Arvicanthis niloticus was parasitized by 2 cestode species, namely Inermicapsifer madagascariensis and the highly dominant Raillietina trapezodes. Raillietina baeri was the only cestode species found in Mastomys erythroleucus, and there was no cestode in M. huberti. Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus. Local host specificity and abundance/prevalence levels suggested variations in the interaction between rodents and cestode intermediate host species among habitats and seasons. © 2010 American Society of Parasitologists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine trypanosomiasis is a severe and prevalent disease that has the greatest impact globally upon working equids due to its distribution across lower income countries. Morbidity and mortality rates are high; disease management strategies in endemic regions are ineffective and cost prohibitive. Individual variation in disease phenotype in other species suggests host factors could reveal novel treatment and control targets but has not been investigated in equids., METHODS: A prospective clinical evaluation of equines presenting for a free veterinary examination was performed in hyperendemic villages in The Gambia. Age, body condition score and body weight were estimated by validated methods, and haematocrit and total protein concentration measured. Animals fulfilling 2 out of 5 clinical inclusion criteria (anaemia, poor body condition, pyrexia, history of abortion, oedema) for a diagnosis of trypanosomiasis received trypanocidal treatment with follow-up at 1 and 2 weeks. Blood samples underwent PCR analysis with specific Trypanosoma spp. primers and results were compared to the subject's clinical and clinicopathological features. A mixed effects generalised linear model was generated to evaluate the association of infection status with degree of pyrexia and anaemia., RESULTS: Morbidity was high within examined (n = 641) and selected (n = 247) study populations. PCR status was not associated with a defined disease phenotype; there was intra- and inter-species variability. Donkeys were more frequently Trypanosoma spp.-positive (P {\textless} 0.001) and febrile (P {\textless} 0.001) than horses, but infected horses were more anaemic (P {\textless} 0.001), and in poorer body condition (P {\textless} 0.001) than donkeys. Sex was correlated to disease phenotype: males were more anaemic (P = 0.03) and febrile (P {\textless} 0.001). Haemoparasite co-infections were more common than a single infection., CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of diversity in trypanosomiasis clinical signs plus variable disease phenotypes within equid subpopulations that warrant further investigation. The complex co-infection profile of field cases requires greater consideration to optimise disease management.},

	abstract = {The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is ???Critically Endangered??? due to a gradual decrease of its population and a continuous degradation of their habitats. Niokolo Koba National Park is considered an important biodiversity area in West Africa and has high conservation value for western chimpanzees. However, Niokolo Koba National Park has been inscribed on the World Heritage list as being in Danger since 2007 due to anthropogenic factors. Over the last 40 years, only sporadic and shortterm studies on the ecology and behavior of chimpanzees in the park have occurred. For this reason, we studied the nesting ecology of a putative chimpanzee community in the Antenna zone. We also identified sympatric medium and large mammals using a camera trap. Chimpanzees mostly used Hexalobus monopetalus for nesting, followed by Pterocarpus erinaceus. Nest heights in the Antenna zone were lower than they are in Assirik, and outside the park at Fongoli and Diaguiri sites despite the presence of potential predators in the park. Predator presence influences nesting height behavior. These data deepen our knowledge about chimpanzees in Senegal, and are useful for the management plan of the park and will contribute to an action plan for their conservation there.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization has recommended the use of cattle for zooprophylaxis as a protective measure against malaria since 1982. However, concern has been raised about this practice, since some studies have shown that the presence of cattle may instead increase malaria prevalence. This study was designed to investigate the effect of passive zooprophylaxis on malaria in an area of moderate seasonal transmission in The Gambia, West Africa. The study was based on a paired-cohort of 204 children aged {\textless} 7 years, sleeping {\textless} 20 m or {\textgreater} 50 m from cattle, and surveys were done from 14 October to 2 December 1997. Entomological investigations showed that the presence of cattle did not alter the risk of malaria transmission in nearby houses. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum between the 2 groups. Although the presence of cattle appeared to be protective against high parasitaemia, cattle were also associated with greater wealth of the children's families. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the decreased risk of high parasitaemia in the group with cattle present was an artefact associated with the higher general wealth of the cattle owners. We concluded that zooprophylaxis is not an effective intervention method against malaria in settings similar to The Gambia.},
