A total of 1248 goats and 438 sheep, predominantly young females, were slaughtered and sampled. Sixty per cent of the females of both species were pregnant. There were no significant differences between the dressing percentages of different breeds and age groups. Sex and stage of pregnancy had a significant influence on carcase yields in both species. In goats the highest carcase yields were obtained during the early dry season. Most of the animals were clinically healthy and there were few pathological findings postmortem. In both species, there was a seasonal fluctuation of packed cell volume (PCV), with a minimum during the rains, and although the prevalence of trypanosomiasis was low it reduced the PCV. Faecal egg counts of Trichostrongylidae were highest during the rainy season and goats had higher faecal egg and coccidial oocyst counts than sheep. In sheep, a breed difference was observed for PCV and an age difference for egg excretion. The peak or higher rates of egg excretion occurred during the rains in both species. The immune status against peste des petits ruminants was significantly lower in goats (39 per cent) than in sheep (49.5 per cent). Antibodies against bluetongue virus were found in 62.6 per cent of goats and 55.8 per cent of sheep.",The Veterinary record,142,1992,1992,cross_sectional,gambia,,

It provides a synopsis of the Senegalese broiler value chain and evaluates the performance and economics of different broiler farm types.Design/methodology/approachA multi-stakeholder workshop and interviews were conducted with key informants to investigate the structure and activities of the Senegalese broiler value chain. The typical farm approach (TFA) was used to construct and analyze ""typical"" farms that represent the most common broiler production systems in Senegal.FindingsThe current situation in the Senegalese broiler value chain is favorable for hatcheries, feed mills, producers and poultry traders. However, the slaughterhouses are not faring well. The farm economic analysis demonstrates that typical medium-scale broiler farms are performing well, due to the use of high-quality feed, chicks and good husbandry. Additionally, the analysis revealed that feed and day-old chick (DOC) costs are the most significant in conventional broiler production in Senegal. Despite the high costs of feed and DOCs, broiler production is profitable for typical farms.Research limitations/implicationsAthough this study provides detailed insights into broiler farm economics in Senegal, it does not include typical integrated large-scale broiler farm-types. Based on our findings, we can predict that such farm types may be more efficient and have lower production costs due to the use of high-quality inputs (chicks and feed), and economies of scale. However, future studies will need to verify this prediction.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, only a few unpublished studies on broiler farm economics in Senegal exist. These studies only provide a basic analysis of the cost of production and profitability, with little consideration of various production systems. Contrastingly, this study provides a detailed economic analysis of different types of conventional broiler farms in key production regions.",Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies,,,,,,10.1108/JADEE-08-2022-0189,

Different components of the analysis repeatedly identified the following key factors: human population growth; declining rainfall; loss of tree cover; trends in land-use including increased areas under cultivation, reduced fallowing and reduced access for grazing; livestock numbers; prices for groundnuts (the main cash crop) and cattle; and indicators of national wealth reflecting cash available to invest in livestock or to purchase livestock products. In many areas tsetse and trypanosomiasis appear to be in decline as a result of habitat destruction but they are likely to persist in others where trypanotolerant animals face a high risk of trypanosomiasis infection and active control may bring significant benefits. Several of the identified trends raise doubts concerning the long-term sustainability of traditional grazing on common land, although improved, intensive management strategies can do much to alleviate these problems.

Arboreal nesting has been linked to predation pressure, but few studies have tested the adaptive nature of this behavior. We collected data at two chimpanzee study sites in southeastern Senegal that differed in predator presence to test the hypothesis that elevated sleeping platforms are adaptations for predator defense. At Assirik in the Parc National du Niokolo-Koba, chimpanzees face four species of large carnivore, whereas at Fongoli, outside national park boundaries, humans have exterminated almost all natural predators. We quantified the availability of vegetation at the two sites to test the alternative hypothesis that differences in nesting reflect differences in habitat structure. We also examined possible sex differences in nesting behavior, community demographic differences, seasonality and nest age differences as variables also potentially affecting nest characteristics and nesting behavior between the two sites. Chimpanzees at Fongoli nested at lower heights and farther apart than did chimpanzees at Assirik and sometimes made nests on the ground. The absence of predators outside of the national park may account for the differences in nest characteristics at the two sites, given the similarities in habitat structure between Fongoli and Assirik. However, Fongoli chimpanzees regularly build arboreal nests for sleeping, even under minimal predation pressure, and this requires explanation.",American Journal of Primatology,70,2000,2001,cross_sectional,senegal,10.1002/ajp.20508,

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to describe the current scope of knowledge for Africa, for the NHP species implicated, their geographical distribution, infection rates with S. mansoni, and to discuss the implications for public health and conservation. Main text: A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization (WHO) library database, World Cat, and ScienceDirect without any language restriction. Studies examining S. mansoni infection of any African NHP species were included. Study types, primate species, their geographical distribution, and parasite diagnostic techniques reported in the studies were qualitatively summarized. Data for species with sample sizes {\textgreater}=10 were included in the meta-analysis. We assessed the reported infection rate, and used a random-effects model to estimate the summary infection rates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity among studies using the I 2 statistics. Twenty-nine publications, from 1960 to 2018, were identified and included in the review. The studies examined a total of 2962 primates belonging to 22 species in 11 genera across ten countries (Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and S. mansoni infections were found in nine species of five genera in all countries. When we excluded studies with sample sizes {\textless} 10, data from 24 studies on 11 species of primates in three genera in ten countries remained in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of infection rate was 10\% (95\% CI: 6-16\%) with high heterogeneity (I 2 = 94.77\%) across countries and species/genera. Among the three genera, Pan had the highest infection rate of 15\% (95\% CI: 0-55\%), followed by Papio at 11\% (95\% CI: 6-18\%), and Cercopithecus at 5\% (95\% CI: 0-14\%). The association between NHP and human infections was positive, but not significant, due to low study sample matches and high variation. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection rate is high in African NHPs, with substantial heterogeneities across species/genera and countries in Africa. Given the evidence for potential spillover and spillback of S. mansoni between African NHPs and humans, further research is urgently needed to understand ecology and mechanisms of transmission of the parasite between NHP and human hosts, in order to inform control strategies of this important neglected tropical disease.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Infectious Diseases of Poverty,8,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-019-0543-7,

The article reports the AFP probability distributions calculated on goats and sheep herds monitored for more than 10 years in three low-input livestock farming systems located from northern to southern Senegal (Louga, Kaymor, and Kolda) and representing different agroecological conditions and animal phenotypes. The AFP distributions were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis accounting for censoring (females lost to follow-up before their first parturition). When measured by the KM estimator of the AFP median, the precocity for both species was almost 4 months later in Louga than in Kaymor and Kolda. In Louga, the precocity was 1.6 months later for sheep than for goats and 2.9 months in Kaymor and Kolda. These estimates were higher than those obtained with the common and crude approach that removes censored data before calculation (relative bias ranged from -12\% to -22\% for the AFP mean depending on species and site) and those already published in previous studies on the same data sets.

These changes are related to the promotion of competitive and performance-based forms of agriculture. In a context of tense relations between farmers and herders, the quest for equitable access to land, which is a guarantee of peace, stability, and balanced economic and social development, is being called into question by the arrival of capital investors and new actors that are highly supported by the State. This situation raises questions about two important issues: (i) the challenge of the sustainable management of natural resources, especially land; and (ii) the socio-political stakes related to the fact that land is a sensitive resource, both politically and socially. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that dominant discourses are being built around representation of unused and available lands. The aim of this article is to address this controversy by questioning land-use planning processes and tools and underlining the reality depicted. We demonstrate that discourses around land availability are built upon sectoral visions that tend to overshadow the realities of land use. Indeed, livestock farming and particularly its mobile form (i.e., pastoralism) is rendered invisible by not being considered in the majority of land-use and agricultural policies. Through a participatory survey of campsites, we show that gathering basic information on livestock farming should not to be reduced to technical issues. Beyond that, we acknowledge that these land-use issues are rooted in sector-based and neoliberal visions of development. We conclude by discussing the importance of effective decentralization in financial and technical means and the development of systemic proficiency that goes beyond normative sectoral views to acknowledge and act on territorial development.",Land Use Policy,120,,,,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106232,

However, there are some exceptions to this rule, and the aim of this paper is to examine one of them. On the mainland of Senegal, Mastomys huberti occupies humid habitats. However, it occurs also on dry and sandy islands (Saloum delta), where its representatives are dwarf. Since water availability appeared to be the limiting factor in these islands when compared to the mainland, we studied water turnover characteristics in relation to body size, in mainland and island populations at the end of the dry season, under both field and laboratory conditions. All populations were found to be water balanced in their natural habitats. They presented similar rates of water turnover, even though island animals were subjected to stronger constraints than mainland ones. Laboratory experiments suggested that the physiological plasticity of one of the island populations may be reduced. Island populations have a higher kidney size to body weight ratio than those from the mainland. We propose that smaller size in the islands allows the maintenance of water balance with a smaller amount of water, and that a higher ratio of kidney filtration surface to body size may help Mastomys huberti to survive in dry islands. We discuss the factors responsible for body size variability and variation in water exchange characteristics and conclude that different factors could explain body size variation among island populations, depending on the species considered and the ecological constraints met within the islands.",Experientia,51,1991,1991,cross_sectional,senegal,,

In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Acta Tropica,152,2008,2012,longitudinal_study,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.08.016,

Given the relatively sophisticated cognitive abilities yet small brain size of living apes compared to humans and even early hominins, observations of wild chimpanzees' reactions to naturally occurring fire can help inform hypotheses about the likely responses of early hominins to fire. We use data on the behavior of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Fongoli, Senegal during two encounters with wildfires to illuminate the similarities between great apes and humans regarding their reaction to fire. Chimpanzees' close relatedness to our lineage makes them phylogenetically relevant to the study of hominid evolution, and the open, hot and dry environment at Fongoli, similar to the savanna mosaic thought to characterize much of hominid evolution, makes these apes ecologically important as a living primate model as well. Chimpanzees at Fongoli calmly monitor wildfires and change their behavior in anticipation of the fire's movement. The ability to conceptualize the ""behavior"" of fire may be a synapomorphic trait characterizing the human-chimpanzee clade. If the cognitive underpinnings of fire conceptualization are a primitive hominid trait, hypotheses concerning the origins of the control and use of fire may need revision. We argue that our findings exemplify the importance of using living chimpanzees as models for better understanding human evolution despite recently published suggestions to the contrary.

However, several other nest function hypotheses have been proposed: antipredation, antipathogen, and thermoregulation. I tested these simple shelter functions of chimpanzee nests in an experiment for which I was the subject in Fongoli, Senegal. I slept 11 nights in chimpanzee nests and on the bare ground to test for differences in sleep quality, potential exposure to disease through bites from possible vectors, and insulation. No difference was found in the total amount of sleep nor in sleep quality; however, sleep was more disturbed on the ground. Differences in sleep disturbance between arboreal and ground conditions seemed primarily due to causes of anxiety and alertness, e.g., vocalizations of terrestrial mammals. Arboreal nest-sleeping seems to reduce risk of bites from possible disease vectors and provide insulation in cold conditions. This preliminary, but direct, test of chimpanzee nest function has implications for the evolutionary transition from limb-roosting to nest-reclining sleep in the hominoids, and from tree-to-ground sleep in the genus Homo.

In a cross-sectional study of 728 peri-urban dairy farmers in nine areas of six West and Central African countries, levels of commercialization and farm characteristics were examined alongside B. abortus seroprevalence estimates to hypothesize the most appropriate model for brucellosis vaccination delivery in each country. Demographic and economic data were collated and used to describe the farming systems currently in place. Furthermore, these data were utilized in a likelihood assessment to generate a quantitative score to hypothesize which of three private-public partnership (PPP) vaccine delivery models, that is 1) transformative, 2) transactional or 3) collaborative, would be most appropriate in each setting. The study sites had substantial differences in their levels of dairy commercialization and the farming practices employed; the heterogeneity across the study sites was evident in the conclusions of which models would be appropriate for vaccination delivery. While Lome (Togo) had a strong indication for a transformative PPP model, Burkina Faso had strong indication for the collaborative PPP model. Of the remaining study sites, the scores were less dominant for any one model with Cameroon and Ivory Coast sites only just scoring highest on the transformative model and Senegal and Mali sites only just scoring highest on the collaborative model.

The prevalence of infestation was higher in the north (33.47\%) compared to the south (25.74\%). Snail populations infestations appear early in the rainy season, with a peak in the middle of the season, and then a decline towards the end of the rainy season. Molecular techniques showed, for the first time, the presence of S. bovis in the Bulinus spp. population of Niakhar. The heterogeneity of snail infestations at the village level must be taken into account in mass treatment strategies. Further studies should help to improve the characterizations of the schistosome population.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.",Pathogens,10,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10070860,

Information on long-term implications of poorly reared young stock is limited. A study to assess practices, challenges and opportunities during rearing of less than 12-month-old calves in traditional cattle herds in the Peanut Basin of Senegal was carried out. Data were collected on 207 farms through farm visits and completion of a questionnaire. Categorical principal component analysis followed by two-step cluster analysis identified two cattle production systems: livestock based (LB: 47.83 \%) and livestock-crop based (LCB, 52.17 \%). On average, 2.81 +/- 0.15 calves were reared per farm. Calves were weaned at the age of 12.27 +/- 0.32 months. A majority of the calves were of indigenous breeds (71.37 \%) and were meant to serve as replacement stock (74.23 \%). The tropical livestock unit for cattle owned was significantly lower in LB compared to LCB farms (12.71 vs. 18.85). Significantly higher number of farmers owned non-indigenous calves, had clean calf rearing area and reported feed availability in LB farms as compared to LCB farms. A majority of farmers (98.50 \%) perceived calf morbidity and mortality as a major challenge in calf rearing. Meanwhile, labour was readily available to assist with calf rearing in 88.24 \% of farms in both systems. Capacity building on improve husbandry practices could enhance calf survival and productivity in surveyed farms.

The consequences of seasonal variations in local stocking densities on the epidemiology of African animal trypanosomiasis are reported. Tsetse abundance at each study site was monitored throughout the study period from trap catches, and cattle censuses at each site were carried out on a monthly basis. Detailed ecological, productivity and health data, including dietary intake and trypanosomiasis prevalence, were collected from selected study herds resident at the two sites and from a third group of (four) herds that migrated annually between the two areas to spend the late dry season period in Niamina East. It was shown that the migration strategy allowed migrants to maintain a high level of green grazing in the diet throughout the year. Cattle were moved to the area of highest tsetse density in the region to obtain this grazing, but it appeared that individual risk of trypanosome infection was diminished by a dilution effect created by locally high livestock densities. Trypanosomiasis prevalences in resident cattle at Niamina East were best correlated with the tsetse catch/trap/day 2 months previously, once this index of tsetse abundance had been corrected to allow for changes in relative stocking density.",Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,87,1989,1990,cross_sectional,gambia,,

This study presents the molecular epidemiology of NTS isolated from poultry in Senegal. Methodology: A total of 261 NTS recovered from broiler farms, chicken carcasses and street vendors were characterized using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) techniques. Results: We observed 20 distinct RAPD profiles corresponding to 18 different serotypes. Strains from each of these 20 groups were further analysed using MLST. Consequently, 12 new MLST alleles and 17 new sequence types were discovered. Three sequence types (S. Kentucky ST198, S. Agona ST13 and S. Istanbul ST33) have previously been described in Senegal and other countries, suggesting that these clones are geographically widely distributed and are circulating in a wide range of hosts. Nine clones showed multi-resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in both humans and animals. However, a novel multi-resistant clone of S. Kentucky ST832 was found. Conclusion: This study gives new insights into the genetic diversity of NTS in Senegal.

The national herd increased from 2010 to 2016, from 3.32 to 3.54 million head of cattle, 5.6 to 6.68 million sheep and 4.8 to 5.7 million goats, i.e. annual growth rates of 1.1\%, 3.2\% and 3.13\% respectively. Thus, due to diversification of local agricultural resources and the strengthening of goat breeding techniques in the Fatick area, a programme aiming to develop the local goat sector was set up in 2010. The programme focused on improving animal husbandry, providing new added values to goat products and structuring the goat sector. This study's aim is to better understand goat rearing systems in the area, in order to propose, together with the herders, ways of improving these systems, taking into account family and socio-cultural considerations. To better evaluate the diversity in different production systems, a survey of animal rearing practices was carried out. The survey involved 45 farmers in four localities. It revealed that the farmers were all agro-pastoralists practising a mixed farming system. The majority (93\%) supplemented their animals with agricultural by-products, agro-forestry and kitchen leftovers. A multiple correspondence analysis identified three groups: cluster 1 (milk producers and processors into traditional curdled milk, selling animals for household needs), cluster 2 (milk processors into yoghurt and cheese) and cluster 3 (goat vendors in pastoral and the agro-pastoral system).

For the last 20 years, many developing countries have been attempting to develop the domestic milk production sector. However, research on the basic realities and the viability status of enterprises within this sector remain largely unproved in many developing countries. This study focuses on the characteristic of smallholder milk producers in The Gambia. Data were collected from 90 smallholder farm households to characterise milk producers and evaluate the profitability and viability status of this activity. Based on current typology of farms and gross margin analyses at farm level, the study identified two resource-based types of smallholder farms. The current milk production system is surely viable. Constraints to increased productivity include lack of improved technology at farm level and weak institutional support. Despite the low viability status, it is shown that milk production generates reliable incomes, which could be a departure for most farmers to intensify farming systems, particularly in areas where no loan schemes exist for purchasing agricultural inputs.

This study aims to elucidate the extent of chimpanzee ecological diversity by scrutinizing (recently) sympatric mammalian fauna at established study sites. We compiled presence or absence data on large mammal species at eight sites: Assirik, Bossou, Budongo, Gombe, Kibale, Lope, Mahale, and Tai. The sites were rank ordered on the most basic ecological variable: annual total rainfall. Only three of the 65 mammalian genera compiled were sympatric with chimpanzees at all sites: Potamochoerus (bushpig), Syncerus (buffalo), and Panthera pardus (leopard). Some subfamilies (e.g. colobines) were present at most sites, but some families (e.g. hyenids) were absent at most sites. Some taxa (e.g. suids, cercopithecines) correlated better than others (e.g. canids) with basic ecological variables. The most extreme chimpanzee study site for which data are available is Assirik, Senegal. Nowhere else are chimpanzees sympatric with Erythrocebus, Alcelaphus, Hippotragus, and Ourebia.

Recently, a progressive, severe neurological syndrome characterised by a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis has been identified and associated with Trypanosoma brucei infection of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of cerebral trypanosomosis is unclear and the clinical syndrome not well described. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to identify host and parasite related risk factors associated with the development of cerebral trypanosomosis and to describe the neurological syndrome associated with cerebral trypanosomosis. History, signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected from 326 horses and donkeys presented to The Gambia Horse and Donkey Trust. Neurological derangements in affected animals were described. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei was performed. The associations between signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters and PCR results were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was 50 \%, with infections dominated by T. congolense (44.1 \%) and a lower intensity of T. brucei (7.4 \%) and T. vivax (6.5 \%). Overall, 54.8 \% of neurological cases were PCR positive for trypanosomosis. Within the neurological sub-population prevalence remained similar to the whole population for T. congolense (48.4 \%) and T. vivax (6.5 \%); whilst the prevalence increased markedly for T. brucei (32.3 \%). Co-infections were identified in 32.3 \% of neurological cases. Donkeys typically presented with progressive cerebral dysfunction and cranial nerve deficits, whereas in horses a progressive spinal ataxia was predominant. Mortality in affected animals was high (82.4 \%). The final multivariable model identified a significant association between body condition score {\textless}=2 (OR 11.4; 95 \% CI 4.6-27.9; P = {\textless}0.001), and T. congolense and T. brucei. coinfection (OR 20.6; 95 \% CI 1.71-244.1; P = 0.016) with the presence of neurological deficits. This study has provided clinically relevant information confirming the link between T. brucei and neurological disease outbreak in the equid population of The Gambia, and crucially identified co-infection with T. brucei and T. congolense as a major risk factor for the development of neurological trypanosomosis. Further research is required to identify the epidemiology of co-infection in equidae of The Gambia, so that cerebral trypanosomosis can be better prevented in this vulnerable population.

Addressing these questions requires building adequate data sets, i.e., covering areas and spanning periods adapted to the invasion processes studied. Rodents include major invasive species, among which the black rat Rattus rattus and the domestic mouse Mus musculus have nearly colonized the entire world, from their native Asian range. To do so, they have benefitted from their ability to cope with human-modified environments and to live in the immediate vicinity of Man, who served as a vector of their dispersal between regions and continents. In Senegal, both R. rattus and M. musculus, initially introduced by early West European colonizers some centuries ago, are currently expanding thanks to road traffic and infrastructure development and rampant urbanization that concerns even remote regions of the country. As part of projects aimed at studying (1) the role of invasive black rat populations in the emergence of zoonotic diseases in southeastern Senegal, and (2) the evolutionary consequences of parasites in R. rattus and M. musculus invasions in Senegal, we conducted a series of field campaigns throughout the southern half of the country, between May 2012 and September 2015. The objectives were to catch commensal small mammals using standard trapping procedures, identify them using morphological or molecular tools, and take samples from them upon autopsy, to look for zoonotic parasites and pathogens. Along with data on individual specimens, information on microhabitats was gathered at each trap position. This resulted in the constitution of a data set of more than 13,000 trapnights, which allowed the capture of more than 3,100 small mammals, all characterized by a series of associated biological, geographical, and environmental data. The small mammals concerned are mainly rodents (10 species), shrews, and hedgehogs. The two invasive rodent species were the most numerous, exceeding in numbers all the other species pooled. This data set makes it possible to study coarse to fine-scaled distribution of species of this commensal community in southern Senegal, as well as the possible determinants of this distribution in terms of habitat preferences and/or interspecific interactions.

Little is known about the extent of variation in prevalence where obvious factors that may drive prevalence (e. g., human contact) are absent, so it is difficult to interpret variation when these factors are present. To address this issue, we studied troops of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) that had almost no contact with humans or domesticated species of plants or animals. We tested the null hypotheses that community composition, richness, and prevalence would be similar between groups in two comparisons: (1) between troops in the same locality with no known differences in drivers of prevalence, and (2) between samples at the same location taken more than 20 years apart. We collected anonymous fecal samples from two troops of baboons living in a wilderness site, Mt. Assirik, in the Niokolo-Koba National Park, Republic of Senegal, West Africa.

Both prevalence and richness were similar in the two valleys, but significant changes emerged in both prevalence and community composition compared with the previous survey in 1978-1979.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed as a cost-effective molecular diagnostic test and is potentially applicable for use in field-based laboratories., PART I: Threshold levels for T. brucei ssp. detection by LAMP were determined using whole equine blood specimens spiked with known concentrations of parasites. Results were compared to OIE antemortem gold standard of T. brucei-PCR (TBR-PCR)., RESULTS I: Threshold for detection of T. brucei ssp. on extracted DNA from whole blood was 1 parasite/ml blood for LAMP and TBR-PCR, and there was excellent agreement (14/15) between tests at high (1 x 103/ml) concentrations of parasites. Detection threshold was 100 parasites/ml using LAMP on whole blood (LWB). Threshold for LWB improved to 10 parasites/ml with detergent included. Performance was excellent for LAMP at high (1 x 103/ml) concentrations of parasites (15/15, 100\%) but was variable at lower concentrations.

In 2012, 20 rats were caught, and their fleas were identified. DNA was extracted from 170 selected fleas and qPCR was carried out to detect Bartonella spp. Subsequently, a Bartonella culture was performed from the rat blood samples and the isolated strains (16S rRNA, rpoB, ftsZ and ITS3) were genotyped. A total of 1117 fleas were collected from 19 rats and identified as Xenopsylla cheopis, the tropical rat flea. Bartonella DNA was detected in 148 of 170 selected fleas (87.1\%). In addition, Bartonella strains were isolated from the blood of 17 rats (85\%).

We compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). Transcriptome analyses identified differential expression between anciently and recently established populations for 364 mouse genes and 83 rat genes. All immune-related genes displaying differential expression along the mouse invasion route were overexpressed at three of the four recently invaded sites studied. Complement activation pathway genes were overrepresented among these genes. By contrast, no particular immunological process was found to be overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes of black rat. Changes in transcriptome profiles were thus observed along invasion routes, but with different specific patterns between the two invasive species. These changes may be driven by increases in infection risks at sites recently invaded by the house mouse, and by stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results constitute a first step toward the identification of immune eco-evolutionary processes potentially involved in the invasion success of these two rodent species.",Scientific Reports,10,2018,2018,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75060-2,

The industrial dairy producers and the pastoralists mutually use each other for their own ends, thereby reinforcing the discrepancy between their objectives and the logic of their systems. The model of intensification is persistent because it plays a political role in constructing alliances between actors from agribusiness, and because choices about land use and resource access are depoliticised and repeatedly made in their favour.

Partial sequence analyses of the tax genes (433 bp) indicated that these baboons were infected by a novel divergent simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV). Analyses of the complete proviral sequence (8,892 bp) for one of these strains (STLV-3/PPA-F3) indicate that this STLV was highly divergent from the HTLV-1 (61.6\% of nucleotide similarity), HTLV-2 (61.2\%), or STLV-2 (60.6\%) prototype. It was, however, much more closely related to the few other known STLV-3 strains, exhibiting 87 and 89\% of nucleotide similarity with STLV-3/PHA-PH969 (formerly PTLV-L/PH969) and STLV-3/CTO-604, respectively.

The finding of a new strain of STLV-3 in a West African monkey (Guinea baboon) greatly enlarges the geographical distribution and the host range of species infected by this PTLV type in the African continent.

Between 1960 and 2010, in three areas within the same region, granivores declined by 39-97\% and insectivores by 61-91\%, losses attributable to the steadily increasing livestock grazing pressure. If these trends hold for all Sahelian rangelands, the extrapolation at the time indicated that 1.5 billion birds would have been lost in just half a century. The aim of this space-for-time substitution study was to investigate whether that extrapolation can be substantiated with data from the eastern Sahel. To permit analysis of the spatial and seasonal variation in grazing pressure and its impact on ground-foraging granivorous and insectivorous birds, we counted birds in 1901 sites across the entire region (Mauritania to Ethiopia) and took landscape photos of these sites to evaluate livestock presence. We also estimated livestock density from our counts of cowpats and of droppings of sheep and goats, and the cover of the soil vegetation. Within the same rainfall zone (200-400 mm/year), the grazing pressure was higher in the Ferlo than elsewhere in the Sahel. Grazing pressure declined in the Ferlo in the course of the dry season, indicating that cattle food supply became depleted. No such seasonal decline was recorded elsewhere in the Sahel. The same pattern was found for ground-foraging birds: a decline during the dry season in the Ferlo, but nowhere else in the same Sahel rainfall zone. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, when the grazing pressure was much lower than today, there were no records of a seasonal decline of ground-foraging birds in the Ferlo. The much lower densities of seed-eating birds in the Ferlo were not exhibited elsewhere in the Sahel, which is consistent with the phenomenon of local overgrazing. The previous extrapolated loss of 1.5 billion birds is therefore too high, because conditions in the Ferlo were found to differ from those experienced elsewhere in Sahel's arid zone. The actual overall loss cannot be specified due to lack of bird counts from the past in the eastern Sahel. The comparison of grazing pressure and bird densities across all rainfall zones of the western and eastern Sahel shows that increasing livestock densities negatively impact bird numbers. Livestock grazing pressure in the west was higher than in the east and most ground-foraging bird species were less common in the west than in the east. Furthermore, the majority of ground-foraging species in West Sahelian savannahs were exclusively confined to the arid and semi-arid zone, but in the east, these species were more widely distributed and also occupied the more humid zone to the south.",Ardea,111,,,,,10.5253/arde.2022.a25,

In total, 223 sheep and 385 goats from five villages were included. Allocation to treatment groups (treated-control) was randomised by village, based on age and sex. Three treatments per rainy season were applied with Fenbendazole (Panacur, Hoechst, 2.5\%, 5 mg/kg). Mean nematode egg excretion per gram faeces (EPG) of the treated groups were significantly reduced by prophylactic anthelmintic treatment, indicating the efficiency of the treatment despite the risk of rapid reinfestation. Weight gain benefits of anthelmintic treatment were observed in all age categories ({\textgreater} 6 month) of sheep but not in goats. Kidding rates were significantly increased whilst the same positive trends were observed for other reproductive parameters (litter size, parturition interval) in both goats and sheep without reaching statistical significance. Birth weights of offspring born out of treated does and ewes were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) than those from the controls. In contrast, growth rates until 3 months of age were not influenced by the treatment status of the dam. Mortality rates until the age of 3 months of kids from treated does were significantly lower than of those from control does. Mean Packed Red Cell Volume (PCV) levels during the rains were significantly higher in treated goats than in control goats. The same trend was observed in sheep. In general, there were no interactions between trypanosome infections and effect of anthelmintic treatment, thus both factors acted independently. Finally, the live weight productivity index (12 months old-offspring in kg/year per dam) for treated dams was 24\% and 47\% higher than in control ewes and does, respectively. It can be concluded that, despite the continuous risk of trypanosome infections which has a negative impact on their productivity, a beneficial effect of anthelmintic treatment was observed in both species but most obviously in goats, measured as an increased production and improved health status. A cost-benefit analysis should be carried out in order to confirm whether prophylactic anthelmintic treatment can be recommended to farmers to increase their income from small ruminant production.

Human can also be infected. The detection of human or animal cases is complicated by the non-specific symptoms close to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in domestic livestock species or Dengue like syndrome in humans. Then, these detections are usually made during RVF investigations in sheep. These domestic animals should take a role in the life cycle of the virus but some evidences of Wesselsbron virus (WSLV) presence in wild animals suggest that the latter may be involved in the virus maintenance in nature. However, the reservoir status of wild vertebrate in general and rodents particularly for WSLV is only based on an isolation from a Cape short-eared gerbil in southern Africa. Most of WSLV isolations are from southern parts of Africa even if it has been found in western and central Africa or Madagascar. In Senegal, there are serological evidences of WSLV circulation in human since the 1970s and some isolations, the last one of which dates back in 1992. Despite the detection of the virus on mosquitoes until the 2000s in different parts of the country, no new human case has been noted. In this paper, we report the WSLV re-emergence in eastern Senegal in 2013 with 2 human cases and its first isolation from a black rat Rattus rattus. Sequencing analyses show the circulation of the same strain between these humans and the commensal rodent. The putative impact on WSLV transmission to human populations could be more important if the reservoir status of the black rat is confirmed.

We used principal component analysis to explore the variation of the hypothesized explanatory variables in space and time and a generalized additive modelling approach to assess the effect of those variables on the likelihood of herd movement between pairs of administrative units. Contrary to environmental variables, the patterns of variation of market prices show significant differences across locations. The explanatory variables at origin had the highest contribution to the model deviance reduction. Biomass production and rainfall were found to affect the likelihood of herd movement for both species on at least 1 year. Market price at origin had a strong and consistent effect on the departure of small ruminant herds. Our study shows the potential benefits of regular monitoring of market prices for future efforts at forecasting livestock movements and associated sanitary risks. Copyright © 2023.

T. pallidum emerged as a highly infectious venereal syphilis agent in South America, probably about 500 years ago, and because of its venereal transmission, it quickly caused a worldwide pandemic. The disease manifests as lesions, including a chancre; then antibodies become detectable when or slightly after the chancre appears, and before the development of a rash and other systemic manifestations. Venereal diseases are poorly known in monkeys. During fieldwork in Senegal, we discovered an epizootic outbreak of venereal disease that we explored. We detected a venereal form of T. pallidum subsp. pertenue infection in green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus), then observed an epizootic outbreak in Senegal and its spread among baboons a year later. Comparative analysis of T. pallidum genomes from the monkeys' chancres and other Treponema genomes showed an acceleration of the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, comparable to that observed in syphilis. Identified T. pallidum clones seem to be epizootic through the acceleration of their mutation rate, which is linked to their larger diffusion. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, 2285 consultations records of equines, admitted in a gate-clinic at Sololo in CRD, were studied retrospectively. The data were recorded in the period between September 1995 and July 2002 and comprised consultations of 2113 horses and 172 donkeys. 'Trypanosome infection' was the most frequently diagnosed condition and accounted for 61\% of the cases. Horses were more frequently diagnosed with trypanosome infections than donkeys (p{\textless}0.001), with an occurrence of 63\% compared to 43\% in donkeys. In both horses and donkeys, trypanosome infections were mainly due to Trypanosoma congolense (64\%) and T. vivax (32\%). There was no difference observed in the occurrence of trypanosome infections in male or female donkeys (p=0.585), but there were more female (67.8\%) horses observed with trypanosome infections than male horses (60.7\%; p=0.003). There was no difference observed in the occurrence of trypanosome infections in donkeys older or younger than 1 year (p=0.130), but more older horses (63.2\% {\textgreater}1 year) were observed with trypanosome infections than young horses (54.5\% {\textless}1 year; p=0.033). The number of donkeys and horses with trypanosome infections decreased during the rainy season (June-September). The majority of equines that were admitted with trypanosome infections were severely anaemic. The average packed cell volume (PCV) declined with increasing parasitaemia (p=0.006). Seventy-four percent of the farmers' predictions of trypanosome infections in their equines were confirmed by darkground-microscopy. That proved that farmers had a fairly accurate knowledge of the diseases affecting their equines. The treatments executed at the gate-clinic were generally effective.

Whilst many studies have evaluated the economic impact of schistosomiasis in humans, to date only one has been performed in livestock in SSA and none in Senegal. This study aimed to estimate the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis in selected regions of Senegal., METHODS: Stochastic partial budget models were developed for traditional ruminant farmers in 12 villages in northern Senegal. The models were parameterised using data from a cross-sectional survey, focus group discussions, scientific literature and available statistics. Two scenarios were defined: scenario 1 modelled a situation in which farmers tested and treated their livestock for schistosomiasis, whilst scenario 2 modelled a situation in which there were no tests or treatment. The model was run with 10,000 iterations for 1 year; results were expressed in West African CFA francs (XOF; 1 XOF was equivalent to 0.0014 GBP at the time of analysis). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertain variables on the disease costs., RESULTS: Farmers surveyed were aware of schistosomiasis in their ruminant livestock and reported hollowing around the eyes, diarrhoea and weight loss as the most common clinical signs in all species. For scenario 1, the median disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 13,408 XOF, 27,227 XOF and 27,694 XOF, respectively. For scenario 2, the disease costs per year and head of cattle, sheep and goats were estimated at 49,296 XOF, 70,072 XOF and 70,281 XOF, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the financial impact of livestock schistosomiasis on traditional subsistence and transhumance farmers is substantial. Consequently, treating livestock schistosomiasis has the potential to generate considerable benefits to farmers and their families. Given the dearth of data in this region, our study serves as a foundation for further in-depth studies to provide estimates of disease impact and as a baseline for future economic analyses. This will also enable One Health economic studies where the burden on both humans and animals is estimated and included in cross-sectoral cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of disease control strategies.

To provide guidance for climate change mitigation strategies in Senegal, it is necessary to obtain reliable estimates of CH4 emissions from Ndama cattle reared in grazing systems, which is the predominant cattle system in the country. The objective of this study was to determine the annual methane emission factor (MEF) for enteric fermentation of Ndama cattle following the IPCC Tier 2 procedure. Our estimated annual MEF at the herd scale was 30.8 kg CH4/TLU (30.7 kg CH4/head/yr for lactating cows and 15.1 kg CH4/head/yr for other cattle). These values are well below the default IPCC emission factor (46 and 31 kg CH4/head/yr for dairy and other cattle, respectively) proposed in the Tier 1 method for Africa. Our study showed that feed digestibility values differ with season (from 46 to 64\%). We also showed that cattle lose weight and adapt to lower feed requirements during the long dry season, with a resulting major reduction in methane emissions.

Common parameters are the annual instantaneous hazard rates, which can be estimated by m/T (where m represents the number of the considered demographic events occurred during the year and T the cumulated animal-time at risk). Different approaches are encountered in the literature for computing T from on-farm survey data. One crude approach (""the 12-month interval approach"") only uses estimations of herds' sizes at beginning and end of the year and aggregated counts of demographic events over the year. I evaluated the potential biases in using four 12-month interval methods (M1-M4) to estimate T. Biases were evaluated by comparing the 12-month estimates to gold-standard values of T. Data came from long-term herd monitoring on cattle and small ruminants in extensive agro-pastoral systems. Animal-times at risks were correctly estimated in average by methods M1, M2 and M4 (average relative biases{\textless}or=6\% in absolute values), except for adult-male small ruminants. For young animals, M2 and M4 showed equivalent biases. M2 is simple to implement and has the advantage of being applicable for any age-group, although M4 is only applicable for young animals. M3 was highly biased and I do not recommend it. Although accurate in average, 12-month interval methods showed highly variable biases. This variability results from interactions between the dates delimiting the 12-month interval and the distributions of the demographic events over time. This phenomenon is particularly important for the adult-male small ruminants. Based on the bias variability observed in the study, the user of 12-month interval methods has to remember that they only provide approximate results and that they cannot completely replace the gold-standard approaches.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,85,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.01.007,

In tropical free-ranged and small-holder systems, where reproduction cycles cannot be individually observed without expensive field surveys, one of these parameters is the average number of parturitions (h) expected by reproductive female, if the female spends the whole year in the herd. A frequent approach for estimating h is to use the ratio h(c) = m/T so-called 'crude annual parturition rate, where m is the observed number of parturitions and T is the total time of presence of the reproductive females in the herd during the year The bias encountered when h is estimated by hc was evaluated in this paper Six methods of estimation were used, where T was the exact observed time of presence (h(c1)) or approximated by monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly averages or final size of the reproductive herd size (h(c2) to h(c6)). Data came from long-term follow-up of cattle and small-ruminant herds (with data recorded at animal level) in extensive agro-pastoral systems in Senegal, In general h was correctly estimated by h(c1). Nevertheless h(c1) was sensitive to competing risks (e.g. deaths, sales and slaughtering of reproductive females) and was seriously biased when intensive withdrawals of females occurred before or during the parturition peak. Reliability of crude rates progressively decreased from h(c2) to h(c6), corresponding to the degradation of information used for approximating I This decrease was much lower for cattle (for which all methods had acceptable reliability) than for small ruminants. Among the compared methods, the lower reliability was observed for hc6 that we do not recommend for small ruminants. Methods h(c5) and h(c6) are currently used in rapid cross-sectional retrospective surveys based on the recall of the farmers on the demographic events which occurred in the herd over the last past 12 months. The study has showed that such surveys and estimates h(c5) and h(c6) can generate seriously biased results.

It has, however, undergone severe richness depletion. Hygienic lifestyle, antimicrobial treatments and altered gut homeostasis (e.g., chronic inflammation) reduce gut microbiome richness and also parasite prevalence; which may confound results. Studying species closely related to humans could help overcome this problem by providing insights into the ancestral relationship between humans, their gut microbiome and their gut parasites. Chimpanzees are a particularly promising model as they have similar gut microbiomes to humans and many parasites infect both species., AIMS: We study the interaction between gut microbiome and enteric parasites in chimpanzees. Investigating what novel insights a closely related species can reveal when compared to studies on humans., METHODS: Using eighty-seven faecal samples from wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Senegal, we combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for gut microbiome characterization with PCR detection of parasite taxa (Blastocystis sp., Strongyloides spp., Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., Plasmodium spp., Filariae and Trypanosomatidae). We test for differences in gut microbiota ecosystem traits and taxonomical composition between Blastocystis and Strongyloides bearing and non-bearing samples., RESULTS: For Blastocystis, twelve differentially abundant taxa (e.g., Methanobrevibacter), including Prevotella and Ruminococcus-Methanobrevibacter enterotype markers, replicate findings in humans. However, several richness indices are lower in Blastocystis carriers, contradicting human studies. This indicates Blastocystis, unlike Strongyloides, is associated to a ""poor health"" gut microbiome, as does the fact that Faecalibacterium, a bacterium with gut protective traits, is absent in Blastocystis-positive samples. Strongyloides was associated to Alloprevotella and five other taxonomic groups. Each parasite had its unique impact on the gut microbiota indicating parasite-specific niches. Our results suggest that studying the gut microbiomes of wild chimpanzees could help disentangle biological from artefactual associations between gut microbiomes and parasites.

Domestic ruminants are the reservoirs of the virus. A study was undertaken during the 2002 rainy season to assess spatial and temporal variations in exposure to mosquito bites in sheep herds, and to evaluate the possible consequences on the risk of RVF transmission to sheep. Mosquitoes were collected with sheep-baited traps. The number of Ae. vexans females (the predominant species during the 2002 rainy season) trapped per trap-night was the dependent variable in statistical analyses. The trapping periods were divided into six series of two to five consecutive days, from July to November 2002. Three temporary ponds were selected according to their ecological features: depth, bank slope, size and vegetation cover. Traps were laid on the pond bank and in the nearest available compound, close to the sheep night pen. Data were analysed using mixed-effects Poisson models. The explanatory variables were the trapping period, the pond, and the capture site. The exposure to mosquito bites varied according to the pond type, suggesting that the risk of transmission was spatially heterogeneous. However, there was no obvious trend in transmission risk due to the effect of the distance from the compound to the pond. The period with the highest exposure was in October, i.e. when transhumant herds left the Ferlo to relocate to their dry-season settlement.

Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress. Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective, risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live in sympatry.",American Journal of Physical Anthropology,163,2011,2011,cross_sectional,senegal,10.1002/ajpa.23221,

Even though many progresses have been done to understand and predict spatial patterns of invasive species, the challenge to identify the underlying determinants of their distribution remains a central question in invasion biology. This is particularly exacerbated in the case of commensal species that strictly depend on humankind for dispersal and perennial establishment of new populations. The distribution of these species is predicted to be influenced by dispersal opportunities and conditions acting on establishment and proliferation, such as environmental characteristics, including spatio-temporal components of the human societies. We propose to contribute to the understanding of the recent spread of a major invasive rodent species, the black rat (Rattus rattus), in the changing southeastern of Senegal. We address the factors that promote the dispersal and distribution of this invasive rodent from the perspective of human geography. We first describe characteristics of human settlements in terms of social and spatial organization of human societies (i.e. economic activities, commercial and agricultural networks, roads connectivity). We then explore the relationship between these characteristics and the distribution of this invasive rodent. Finally we propose that historical and contemporary dynamics of human societies have contributed to the risk of invasion of the black rat. We argue that the diffusion processes of invasive species cannot be considered as a result of the spatial structure only (i.e. connectivity and distance), but as a part of the human territory that includes the social and spatial organization. Results suggest that the distribution of invasive rodents partly results from the contemporary and inherited human socio-spatial systems, beyond the existence of suitable ecological conditions that are classically investigated by biologists.",Plos One,11,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0163547,

It is necessary to know the parasitological situation of the primates that are under surveillance in the park. Aim: To estimate the prevalence and diversity of gastrointestinal parasites, including zoonotic potential parasites, in baboons in the Niokolo-Koba National Park located in Senegal. Method: Fecal samples (n = 50) from two groups of baboons (A and B) were collected in October 2019. The samples were processed using the flotation technique and the modified Ritchie method. Slides were examined microscopically and the parasite identification was based on morphology, color, and parasite content. Results: A total of seven nematodes (Strongyloides sp., Trichirus sp., Ancylostoma sp., Mammo monogamus, Enterobius sp., Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyle digestif), one cestode (Bertiella sp.), and one trematode (Fasciolopsis sp.) were identified. The overall prevalence was 78\%, while the prevalence of poly-infected samples was 49\%. The parasite with zoonotic potential, S. stercoralis, was identified in group B samples. Trichuris sp., which is common and pathogenic to humans and primates, was present with prevalence of 52\% and of 32\% in groups A and B, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that baboons are infested with zoonotic parasites and this situation could expose people working in this park to infection.

A total of 52 adult tapeworms were collected from sheep and cattle. Although the tapeworms of the two hosts were morphologically very close, phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 and SSU rDNA gene sequences showed that they were divided into two clades corresponding each to a host. The maximum pairwise divergence between the clades were 12.1\% in cox1 and 2.9\% in SSU rDNA, indicating they are distinct species. The tapeworms collected from sheep were morphologically identified as Thysaniezia ovilla, a cosmopolitan species in domestic ruminants. Detailed morphological observations revealed a consistent difference between the tapeworms obtained from sheep and those from cattle. The latter were identified as Thysaniezia connochaeti.

It causes two types of diseases, a self-limiting gastroenteritis and an invasive, more threatening, infection. Salmonella gastroenteritis is caused by several serotypes and is common worldwide. In contrast, invasive salmonellosis is rare in high-income countries (HIC) while frequent in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Invasive Nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS), corresponding to serotypes other than Typhi and Paratyphi, have emerged in sSA and pose a significant risk to public health. We conducted a wholegenome sequence (WGS) analysis of 72 strains of Salmonella isolated from diarrheic human patients and chicken meat sold in multipurpose markets in Dakar, Senegal. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing combined with WGS data analysis revealed frequent resistance to fluoroquinolones and the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination that are among the most used treatments for invasive Salmonella. In contrast, resistance to the historical firstline drugs chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and to cephalosporins was rare. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was lower in clinical isolates compared to chicken strains pointing to the concern posed by the excessive use of antimicrobials in farming. Phylogenetic analysis suggested possible transmission of the emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) Kentucky ST198 and serotype Schwarzengrund from chicken to human. These results stress the need for active surveillance of Salmonella and AMR in order to address invasive salmonellosis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella strains and other important bacterial diseases in sSA.Copyright © 2022 Dieye et al.

Methods include a description and a quantification of the interspecific relations between Green and Paras monkeys. Demographic structure and SIV seroepidemiology of the population are also studied. The tendency of Green monkeys to associate with Patas monkeys was measured using two methods : (I) measuring proportion of time spent in association with Paras Monkeys by one focus Green Monkeys troop; and (2) generalisation of the result by measuring proportion of troops containing Green monkeys associated with Paras Monkeys. Direct observation of interspecific interactions focused on contacts and exchange of biologic fluids. On the basis of 12 days uninterrupted observation, one focus troop of green monkeys spent a mean of 2 h 26 mn per day in association with Patas monkeys, which corresponds to 19 \% of their day time. On the basis of 114 independent troops encounters, 18 \% (57 \% of plurispecific troops) of the troops include mixed individuals of Green and Paras Monkeys. This value allows the extension of the result to the whole monkey population of the Fathala forest. All kinds of social behaviour, hedonic and agonistic, have been observed between Green and Paras monkeys. Retrovirus transmission risk behaviour included mucous membrane contact with biologic fluids: biting and genital grooming. One easily identified female Paras is known to have given birth to five infants from Green monkeys father(s), arguing for the existence of interspecific sexual relations. On the basis of preliminary results of one group of Green Monkeys intensive study, frequency of retrovirus transmission risk behaviour could be estimated at more than 50 per year.

Outflows from the flock and new-born animals were recorded and data on housing and management were compiled. Reported mortality rates were higher in goats than in sheep, but for both species highest in the moderate risk area. The peak of trypanosome infections lagged the peak of tsetse densities by 1-3 months in both areas. Trypanosoma vivax was the predominant species found in the infected animals, followed by T. congolense. Trypanosome prevalence was, in general, higher in sheep than in goats but only significantly higher during Year 1 in the moderate risk area. Trypanosome infection reduced the PCV level significantly and seasonal effects indicated significantly lower PCV levels during the rains. Trypanosome infection significantly depressed weight gain in both species at periods where infection rates were highest. In both species considerably lower weight gains were observed during the rainy season. Abortion rates were higher in goats than in sheep in both study sites, and highest in the high-risk site. Trypanosome infection in ewes in the high risk area increased lamb mortality significantly but had no effect on birth weights, nor on growth rates up to 4 months. Offspring mortality up to 4 months was generally high at both sites. Trypanosome infection in the dam between 3.5 to 7 months post parturition significantly increased parturition interval in both species. Peak faecal egg output occurred at the end of the rainy season and was highest for both species in the moderate risk site. Poor grazing management was found responsible for a seasonal nutritional constraint. Based on these results, these breeds of sheep and goats can be considered as trypanotolerant since they are able to remain productive under high and moderate levels of trypanosome challenge. Nevertheless, trypanosomosis affected their health and production level as shown by reduced PCV levels, depressed weight gains, longer parturition intervals and higher lamb mortality. In addition, during the rains, helminth infections and poor management leading to nutritional constraints had also a negative impact on health and production and therefore influenced the innate resilience to trypanosomosis in those indigenous breeds.

The objective of the study was to improve the assessment of fodder intake by livestock grazing rangelands in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, The study was conducted in the service area of a borehole that includes 354 pastoral settlements and a total of 11,000 cattle and 1800 small ruminants. The grazing behavior of five steers was monitored monthly. Their forage intake was estimated every month from hand plucking simulations of all the bites of forage taken by the steers 24 h out of 48. The feces they excreted during the day were collected in fecal bags. Near infrared spectrum (NIRS) images were used to analyze 80 samples of these feces, and the data were then added to an existing reference data set to predict fodder intake and digestibility using NIBS. The complete and contextualized data base was then used to predict the daily fodder intake and its digestibility by cattle, sheep and goats whose fresh feces were systematically and randomly sampled every month in the study area (768 samples). Annual means of the daily dry matter fodder intake were 68.4 +/- 6.4 g/kg LW0.75 or 17.2 +/- 1.7 g/kg LW for cattle, 73.1 +/- 5.3 g/kg LW07.5 or 34.3 +/- 2.8 g/kg LW for sheep, and 74.7 +/- 8.7 g/kg LW0.75 or 37.1 +/- 4.4 g/kg LW for goats. The annual mean organic matter digestibility of grazed fodder was higher for goats (67.4 +/- 3.9\%) than for sheep (64.1 +/- 3.2\%) and cattle (59.3 +/- 3.8\%). The seasonal variations in diet digestibility were bigger for cattle than for sheep, and smaller for goats. The standard reference used to assess livestock fodder intake in tropical Africa relies on a fixed daily intake rate per unit live weight of 25 g/kg LW. Our results show that this method overestimates (+ 45\%) intake by cattle, especially in the dry season, and underestimates intake by small ruminants (-24\%). Alternative assessment methods are proposed either relying on a single standard annual intake per metabolic weight unit for all ruminant species, 73 g/kg LW0.75 per day, or on separate annual intake norms per live weight unit for cattle (18 g/kg LW per day) and small ruminants (34 g/kg LW per day). In both cases, modulations (+/- 12\%) of the norm are proposed for use in the wet and dry season.",Livestock Science,216,,,,,10.1016/j.livsci.2018.07.002,

Anthropogenic landuse changes affect the distribution and availability of suitable definitive and intermediate hosts, increasing opportunities for hybridization between human and animal schistosomes with subsequent zoonotic transmission. This can have a substantial impact on the dynamics and distribution of schistosomiasis, with further challenges and constraints for effective control. Our aim was to elucidate the role of different definitive hosts as reservoirs of zoonotic Schistosoma single species and hybrids in a region of northern Senegal subject to important anthropogenic change. Extensive and systematic parasite sampling from human, livestock, and rodent definitive hosts, combined with snail intermediate hosts, were performed over three years across key transmission sites in northern Senegal. Multi-locus molecular analyses of all Schistosoma isolates, followed by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI), were used to infer phylogenetic and transmission dynamics between the circulating zoonotic Schistosoma species/hybrids and their hosts. Molecular analyses confirmed the presence of widespread viable hybridization within and between Schistosoma species of humans and animals. Phylogenetic analyses indicated shared transmission of zoonotic Schistosoma species and hybrids between humans and animals (both wild and domestic), providing unique insights into the role of different host species in maintaining transmission. Our study emphasizes the need for a One Health multi-host framework for schistosomiasis control in both people and animals living in high zoonotic transmission zones of sub-Saharan Africa.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,101,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.abstract2019,

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protective efficacies of inactivated and attenuated vaccines to protect sheep against heartwater in The Gambia. An inactivated vaccine, prepared from E. ruminantium (Gardel stock), and a live attenuated vaccine from E. ruminantium (Senegal stock), were evaluated in two independent on-station trials. A local stock of E. ruminantium (Kerr Seringe) was used as challenge material. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines provided 43\% and 100\% protection, respectively, against virulent needle challenge. In a subsequent field trial, the attenuated vaccine protected 75\% of sheep against virulent tick challenge, which was fatal for all control sheep. Quantification by real-time PCR showed that an immunising dose of approximately 23,000 attenuated E. ruminantium organisms was sufficient. Moreover, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated that the local Kerr Seringe genotype caused mortality amongst control sheep, whereas fatalities in the vaccinated group could be attributed to a different genotype. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Consecutive cross-sectional surveys conducted every 5 months among {\textasciitilde}15\% of participating households show that despite project-provided training and inputs, there was only limited uptake of many ""best practices."" Few households constructed improved henhouses; vaccination rates varied and were highest when support was provided. Poultry mortality was high. Egg productivity remained average for village poultry systems, and egg consumption remained low (two to six eggs consumed per household per fortnight). However, children whose mothers were exposed to project messages on nutrition were more likely to eat eggs, and consumption was consistently higher among households with chickens. Women's involvement in chicken rearing was widespread, but their control over revenues from the sale of poultry products was limited. Key lessons learned from implementation were as follows: (a) strong behaviour change communication is needed to encourage egg consumption, (b) nutrition-sensitive village poultry programmes should often focus more on improved practices than improved breeds, (c) supporting women's chicken production is not a route to empowerment without complementary activities that directly support women's ownership and decision making. There is also a need for rigorous research on the role of village poultry in livelihoods, food systems, and consumption as well as the structure of poultry and egg markets in low-resource areas.

The main objective of this review was to investigate available literature on strains of Brucella in order to provide a state of art-knowledge on species and biovars reported in cattle from West Africa. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant data on species and biovars of Brucella in cattle from Western African countries. This search included studies presenting bacteriological and/or molecular results of identification and typing, relied on international classification methods with no time limit and no language restrictions. Studies reporting results of identification at genus level only were not considered for this review. This review revealed that Brucella abortus was the most prevalent species in cattle from West Africa, in line with host preference for Brucellae. So far, biovars 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and intermediate biovar 3/6 of B. abortus were reported in cattle in the region.

Influenza A viruses were diagnosed using RT-qPCR and a subset of positive samples for H3 and H1 subtypes were selected for full genome amplification and NGS sequencing. Serum samples were tested by HI assay for the detection of antibodies recognizing four AIVs, including H9N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H5N2. Between September 2018 and December 2019, 1691 swine nasal swabs were collected and tested. Influenza A virus was detected in 30.7\% (520/1691), and A/H1N1pdm09 virus was the most commonly identified subtype with 38.07\% (198/520), followed by A/H1N2 (16.3\%) and A/H3N2 (5.2\%). Year-round influenza activity was noted in pigs, with the highest incidence between June and September. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the IAVs were closely related to human IAV strains belonging to A/H1N1pdm09 and seasonal H3N2 lineages. Genetic analysis revealed that Senegalese strains possessed several key amino acid changes, including D204 and N241D in the receptor binding site, S31N in the M2 gene and P560S in the PA protein.

Specifically, biodiversity assessments will better elucidate the chimpanzee extinction risk here and yield baselines for monitoring. We compared mammal species richness between Fongoli (unprotected) and Assirik in Niokolo-Koba National Park to assess the efficacy of the only nationally protected area where chimpanzees range in this country. The primary habitat difference between these sites was the degree of human activity. Although Assirik and Fongoli had similar mammal assemblages and were equivalent in primate species richness, the protected area was higher in species richness overall, particularly for ungulates and carnivores. The protected status and management plan of Niokolo-Koba almost certainly resulted in fewer mammal extinctions. In unprotected areas, the flexible behavioural responses of chimpanzees to human-driven landscape dynamics is likely essential to their long-term survival. Furthermore, the near absence of chimpanzee killings in this country greatly facilitates conservation efforts.

The objective of this study was to assess the current prevalence of BT in small ruminants and the serotypes circulating in Senegal. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the fourteen regions of Senegal. After the sampling campaign, sera collected in sheep and goats herds were screened for the presence of Bluetongue virus (BTV) specific antibodies using c-Elisa. The whole blood of seropositive animals was further analyzed by RT-qPCR and positive samples were typed to identify BTV serotypes. Analysis of several risk factors such as age, sex and species of animals was performed using logistic regression. The overall seroprevalence of BTV in Senegal was 72.6\% (95\% CI: 70.3-74.9\%) with 75.9\% (95\% CI: 72.2-79.5\%) in goat and 70.6\% (95\% CI: 67.5-73.6\%) in sheep.

In rodents, the genus Gerbillus characteristic of North African and Asian arid habitats has been affected by this climatic and environmental trends. Several species of this genus showed a southward range expansion in recent years into the Sahelian bioclimatic zone. Recent sampling in several localities of West Africa (Mali, Niger and Senegal) enabled us to collect numerous specimens of small gerbils. An integrative study of these samples using molecular, morphological and cytogenetical methods revealed that many of them were attributable to Gerbillus nancillus, a secretive and poorly known species. Gerbillus nancillus appears characterized by a well differentiated karyotype with 2n = 56 chromosomes, and to represent a unique genetic lineage within this genus. Body and skull measurements of G. nancillus were compared with those of the morphologically similar Gerbillus henleyi, which provided diagnostic clues between them. These new data significantly expand the distribution area of G. nancillus, which now ranges from Sudan in the East to Senegal in the West. G. nancillus is here reported from numerous new localities in Niger and Mali, and for the first time in Senegal, which raises questions about the origin of its presence and the colonization routes it followed to get there.

They are the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a disease of considerable medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions. Schistosomes undergo a sexual reproductive stage within their mammalian host enabling interactions between different species, which may result in hybridization if the species involved are phylogenetically close. In Senegal, three closely related species in the Schistosoma haematobium group are endemic: S. haematobium, which causes urogenital schistosomiasis in humans, and S. bovis and S. curassoni, which cause intestinal schistosomiasis in cows, sheep and goats. Methodology/Principal Findings: Large-scale multi-loci molecular analysis of parasite samples collected from children and domestic livestock across Senegal revealed that interactions and hybridization were taking place between all three species. Evidence of hybridization between S. haematobium/S. curassoni and S. haematobium/S. bovis was commonly found in children from across Senegal, with 88\% of the children surveyed in areas of suspected species overlap excreting hybrid miracidia. No S. haematobium worms or hybrids thereof were found in ruminants, although S. bovis and S. curassoni hybrid worms were found in cows. Complementary experimental mixed species infections in laboratory rodents confirmed that males and females of each species readily pair and produce viable hybrid offspring. Conclusions/Significance: These data provide indisputable evidence for: the high occurrence of bidirectional hybridization between these Schistosoma species; the first conclusive evidence for the natural hybridisation between S. haematobium and S. curassoni; and demonstrate that the transmission of the different species and their hybrids appears focal. Hybridization between schistosomes has been known to influence the disease epidemiology and enhance phenotypic characteristics affecting transmission, morbidity and drug sensitivity. Therefore, understanding and monitoring such inter-species interactions will be essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies across such potential hybrid zones. © 2013 Webster et al.",Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases,7,2009,2010,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002110,

However, our ancestors' reliance on controlled forms of fire-i.e., for cooking-was likely preceded by a long familiarity with fire beginning with passive exploitation of naturally burned landscapes and followed by intermediate steps including active ecological modification via intentional burning. Here we explore our pyrophilic beginnings using observational data from savanna-dwelling chimpanzees. These data highlight the extent to which anthropogenic burning impacts the behavior and ecology of sympatric primates and provides an opportunity to study the ways in which apes living in a fire-altered world exploit opportunities presented by burning. Using monthly burn scar data and daily range use data we quantify the impact of burning episodes on chimpanzee habitat. Over the course of one dry season, approximately 74\% of the total estimated range of the Fongoli community of savanna-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) was impacted by fire. We combine fire occurrences with behavioral data to test for relationships between burning and rate of encounter with food items and duration of subsequent patch residence time.

Remarkably, most bachelor males maintained strong bonds with multiple primary males, indicating that bachelor males play an important role in the cohesion of the parties. A clear male dominance hierarchy could not be established due to the high degree of uncertainty in individual rank scores, yet bachelor males were more likely to be found at the low end of the dominance hierarchy. Average relatedness was significantly higher between strongly bonded males, suggesting that kin biases contribute to the social preferences of males. Long-term data will be needed to test how male bonds affect male tenure and ultimately reproductive success. Significance statement Males living in social groups may employ different strategies to increase their reproductive success, from fierce fighting to opportunistic alliance formation or the development of long-term bonds. To shed light on the factors that shape male strategies, we investigated male-male social relationships in the multilevel society of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) where ""primary"" males are associated with a small number of females and their offspring in ""units"" while other males are ""bachelors."" Strong bonds occurred among and between primary and bachelor males and strongly bonded males were, on average, more closely related. Bachelor males typically had multiple bond partners and thus play an important role in the fabric of Guinea baboon societies. Across primate species, neither dispersal patterns nor social organization clearly map onto the presence of strong bonds in males, suggesting multiple routes to the evolution of male bonds.",Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,75,2014,2015,cross_sectional,senegal,10.1007/s00265-020-02960-8,

This paper attempts to answer three questions related to the sub-Saharan region: (1) can a change in the woody vegetation explain the decline of migratory birds feeding in trees, (2) ditto for the ground vegetation and bird species searching for food on the ground, and (3) are African bird species also in decline? The analysis is confined to the western Sahel (annual rainfall 100-400 mm, 15.5-18 degrees N and 14.7-16 degrees W), a region intensively used as rangeland but too dry for agriculture. The woody cover, largely stable before 1970, declined in the driest zone by 90\% between the 1960s and 2000s, and by 40\% in the more humid zone where the woody cover was already low in the 1960s. The woody vegetation changed in many places from an Acacia savanna into an open savanna with scattered bushes and few trees, concomitant with a shift in species composition. These changes took place during a prolonged drought (1969-1992), and were aggravated by increased grazing pressure after the construction of boreholes as evident from the loss of woody cover close to boreholes. A comparison of bird composition and densities in grazed and ungrazed areas and in three study sites intermittently surveyed between 1960 and 1994, with our surveys in the same sites in 2014-2015, revealed about 80\% losses for birds feeding on the ground. The increased grazing pressure of livestock must have caused a large reduction of the soil seed bank and most likely also of insects. Between 15 and 16 degrees W an estimated 8 million arboreal birds, mainly migrants, and 30 million ground-feeding birds, mainly granivorous residents, lost their habitat. Assuming that this zone is representative for the Sahelian rangelands as a whole, 1.5-2.0 billion birds have lost their habitat in half a century.",Journal of Arid Environments,155,,,,,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2018.01.013,

Validation data sets were dichotomized according to the results of a virus neutralization test in sera obtained from RVF-endemic (Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda, and Yemen) and RVF-free countries (France, Poland, and the USA). Cut-off values were defined using the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis. Estimates of the diagnostic specificity of the RVFV rNP I-ELISA in animals from RVF-endemic countries ranged from 98.6\% (cattle) to 99.5\% (sheep) while in those originating from RVF-free countries, they ranged from 97.7\% (sheep) to 98.1\% (goats). Estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity in ruminants from RVF-endemic countries ranged from 90.7\% (cattle) to 100\% (goats). The results of this large-scale international validation study demonstrate the high diagnostic accuracy of the RVFV rNP I-ELISA. Standard incubation and inactivation procedures evaluated did not have an adverse effect on the detectable levels of the anti-RVFV IgG in ruminant sera and thus, together with recombinant antigen-based I-ELISA, provide a simple, safe, and robust diagnostic platform that can be automated and carried out outside expensive bio-containment facilities. These advantages are particularly important for less-resourced countries where there is a need to accelerate and improve RVF surveillance and research on epidemiology as well as to advance disease control measures.",Viruses-Basel,13,,,,,10.3390/v13081651,

Rodents are prominent invasive species, and act as reservoirs in many zoonotic infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the link between the distribution and spread of two parasite taxa (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma lewisi) and the progressive invasion of Senegal by two commensal rodent species (the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus). M. m. domesticus and R. rattus have invaded the northern part and the central/southern part of the country, respectively. Native and invasive rodents were caught in villages and cities along the invasion gradients of both invaders, from coastal localities towards the interior of the land. Molecular diagnosis of the two trypanosomatid infections was performed using spleen specimens. In the north, neither M. m. domesticus nor the native species were carriers of these parasites. Conversely, in the south, 17.5\% of R. rattus were infected by L. major and 27.8\% by T. lewisi, while very few commensal native rodents were carriers. Prevalence pattern along invasion gradients, together with the knowledge on the geographical distribution of the parasites, suggested that the presence of the two parasites in R. rattus in Senegal is of different origins. Indeed, the invader R. rattus could have been locally infected by the native parasite L. major. Conversely, it could have introduced the exotic parasite T. lewisi in Senegal, the latter appearing to be poorly transmitted to native rodents. Altogether, these data show that R. rattus is a carrier of both parasites and could be responsible for the emergence of new foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis, or for the transmission of atypical human trypanosomiasis in Senegal.",Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases,12,2013,2014,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006615,

Thus in this study, we monitored the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response in extensively managed newborn lambs and kids at three sites in The Gambia. Method(s): We used a nested pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA in a longitudinal study to monitor the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response respectively, in 77 newborn lambs and kids under a traditional husbandry system at three sites (Kerr Seringe, Keneba, Bansang) in The Gambia where heartwater is known to occur. The animals were monitored for field tick infestation and the comparative performance of the two assays in detecting E. ruminantium infection was also assessed. Result(s): The infection rate detected by pCS20 PCR varied between 8.6\% and 54.8\% over the 162-day study period. Nineteen per cent of the animals in week 1 post-partum tested positive by pCS20 PCR with half of these infections (7/14) detected in the first 3 days after birth, suggesting that transmission other than by tick feeding had played a role. The earliest detectable A. variegatum infestation in the animals occurred in week 16 after birth. Antibodies detected by MAP1-B ELISA also varied, between 11.5\% and 90\%. Although there is considerable evidence that this assay can detect false positives and due to this and other reasons serology is not a reliable predictor of infection at least for heartwater. In contrast to the pCS20 PCR, the serological assay detected the highest proportion of positive animals in week 1 with a gradual decline in seropositivity with increasing age. The pCS20 PCR detected higher E. ruminantium prevalence in the animals with increasing age and both the Spearman's rank test (rs = -0.1512; P = 0.003) and kappa statistic (-0.091 to 0.223) showed a low degree of agreement between the two assays. Conclusion(s): The use of pCS20 PCR supported by transmission studies and clinical data could provide more accurate information on heartwater epidemiology in endemic areas and single-occasion testing of an animal may not reveal its true infection status. The view is supported because both the vector and vertical transmission may play a vital role in the epidemiology of heartwater in young small ruminants; the age range of 4 and 12 weeks corresponds to the period of increased susceptibility to heartwater in traditionally managed small ruminants. © 2007 Faburay et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Bmc Infectious Diseases,7,2002,2002,cross_sectional,gambia,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-7-85,

Knowledge of the routes followed by herds is therefore core to guiding the implementation of preventive and control measures for transboundary animal diseases, land use planning and conflict management. However, the lack of quantitative data on livestock movements, together with the high temporal and spatial variability of herd movements, has so far hampered the production of fine resolution maps of animal movements. This paper proposes a general framework for mapping potential paths for livestock movements and identifying areas of high animal passage potential for those movements.

Genetic studies are restricted to a small number of isolates and based on molecular markers that evolve too slowly to resolve the relationships between American and West African populations and, thus, unable us to uncover the recent history of T. vivax in the New World. Methods: T. vivax genetic diversity, population structure and the source of outbreaks was investigated through the microsatellite multiloci (7 loci) genotype (MLGs) analysis in South America (47isolates from Brazil, Venezuela and French Guiana) and West Africa (12 isolates from The Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin and Nigeria). Relationships among MLGs were explored using phylogenetic, principal component and STRUCTURE analyses. Results: Although closely phylogenetically related, for the first time, genetic differences were detected between T. vivax isolates from South America (11 genotypes/47 isolates) and West Africa (12 genotypes/12 isolates) with no MLGs in common. Diversity was far greater across West Africa than in South America, where genotypes from Brazil (MLG1-6), Venezuela (MLG7-10) and French Guiana (MLG11) shared similar but not identical allele composition. No MLG was exclusive to asymptomatic (endemic areas) or sick (outbreaks in non-endemic areas) animals, but only MLGs1, 2 and 3 were responsible for severe haematological and neurological disorders. Conclusions: Our results revealed closely related genotypes of T. vivax in Brazil and Venezuela, regardless of endemicity and clinical conditions of the infected livestock. The MLGs analysis from T. vivax across SA and WA support clonal propagation, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the SA populations examined here derived from common ancestors recently introduced from West Africa. The molecular markers defined here are valuable to assess the genetic diversity, to track the source and dispersion of outbreaks, and to explore the epidemiological and pathological significance of T. vivax genotypes.",Parasites \& Vectors,7,,,,,10.1186/1756-3305-7-210,

The zoonotic, multi-host nature of many digenean trematodes is a significant challenge for disease control programmes in endemic areas. However, our understanding of the epidemiological role that animal reservoirs, particularly wild hosts, may play in the transmission of zoonotic trematodiases suffers a dearth of information, with few, if any, standardised, reliable diagnostic tests available. We combined qualitative and quantitative data derived from post-mortem examinations, coprological analyses using the Mini-FLOTAC technique, and molecular tools to assess parasite community composition and the validity of non-invasive methods to detect trematode infections in 89 wild Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) from northern Senegal. Result(s): Parasites isolated at post-mortem examination were identified as Plagiorchis sp., Anchitrema sp., Echinostoma caproni, Schistosoma mansoni, and a hybrid between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis. The reports of E. caproni and Anchitrema sp. represent the first molecularly confirmed identifications for these trematodes in definitive hosts of sub-Saharan Africa. Comparison of prevalence estimates derived from parasitological analysis at post-mortem examination and Mini-FLOTAC analysis showed non-significant differences indicating comparable results between the two techniques (P = 1.00 for S. mansoni; P = 0.85 for E. caproni; P = 0.83 for Plagiorchis sp.). A Bayesian model, applied to estimate the sensitivities of the two tests for the diagnosis of Schistosoma infections, indicated similar median posterior probabilities of 83.1\% for Mini-FLOTAC technique and 82.9\% for post-mortem examination (95\% Bayesian credible intervals of 64.0-94.6\% and 63.7-94.7\%, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that the Mini-FLOTAC could be applied as an alternative diagnostic technique for the detection of the zoonotic S. mansoni and other trematodes in rodent reservoirs. The implementation of non-invasive diagnostics in wildlife would offer numerous advantages over lethal sampling methodologies, with potential impact on control strategies of zoonotic helminthiases in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and on fostering a framework of animal use reduction in scientific practice.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Parasites and Vectors,12,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3613-6,

A total of 58 isolates, each from a separate farm, were characterized for AMR, virulence, and AMR genes, phylogroup, serogroup, biofilm formation, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and for two isolates, whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Fifty isolates (86.2\%) were multidrug resistant. Many AMR genes were detected, including variants of blaCTX-M encoding resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (five isolates [8.6\%]). Most fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible isolates (21/26) were carriers of mutations in gyrA (Ser83Leu, Asp87Asn, and/or Asp87Tyr) and/or parC (Ser80Ile) genes. Forty-nine (84.5\%) isolates exhibited at least one of the virulence markers of APEC, among which 23 (39.7\%) were defined as potential virulent APEC. In addition, 10 isolates, of which 9 were defined as APEC, carried virulence profiles corresponding to ExPEC. Seven isolates, of which six were classified as ExPEC, belonged to phylo-serogroup F-O25, and following WGS of two of these isolates, were found to belong to the serotype O25:H1 and to the sequence type ST624. Some isolates classified as ExPEC, including F-O25, were found to strongly produce biofilm, suggesting their capability to persist for long time in the environment. F-O25-isolates, although found in different widely separated farms, formed a single cluster that included clones, suggesting that these isolates may have originated from a common source.

We paid special attention to potential human-driven sources of infection and transmission pathways. Potential diarrhoea-causing protist parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, Entamoeba histolytica) were detected at low infection rates (and densities) or absent, whereas commensals (Entamoeba dispar) or protist of uncertain pathogenicity (Blastocystis sp.) were far more abundant. We detected Sarcocystis spp. in chimpanzee faeces. Blood protist parasites such as Plasmodium spp. and Trypanosoma brucei spp. (the etiological agents of malaria and sleeping sickness, respectively, in humans) were also found at low prevalences, but microfilariae of the nematode Mansonella perstans were frequently found. Molecular analyses primarily revealed host-adapted species/genotypes and an apparent absence of gastrointestinal clinical manifestations in infected chimpanzees.

Morphological analysis by the light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy identified three Avitellina ""morphospecies"": A. centripunctata and Avitellina sp.2 were detected in sheep while Avitellina sp.3 was identified in cattle. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the complete mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1) sequences revealed that 101 Avitellina tapeworms were divided into 54 haplotypes grouped into three clades, of which two were specific to sheep and one specific to cattle. Three morphospecies corresponded to each of three clades and the maximum pairwise divergence among the clades ranged from 9.7 to 18.5\% in cox1. The present study demonstrates the unexpected diversity of Avitellina tapeworms in domestic ruminants, and emphasize the necessity of re-evaluation of the taxonomy of the genus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports,18,2013,2014,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100337,

Savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes vents) living in the Mandingue plateau of Senegal and Mali use caves for thermoregulation, where these refugia provide a cool microclimate during the hot, dry season. In this study, we examined cave use frequency for a chimpanzee community in southeastern Senegal. We used images from a camera trap placed at the mouth of a large laterite cave to investigate the hypotheses that sex, reproductive state, and seasonality influence the frequency of cave use. The camera collected 14,053 still images of chimpanzees between 2011 and 2013 over 325 camera trap days. Our results indicate no difference in cave use frequency between males and females overall. However, female reproductive state did significantly influence cave use, with lactating mothers using the cave more frequently than both males and nonlactating females. Chimpanzees used the cave during the hottest times of the day and were more likely to visit the cave during periods of low water availability and high maximum temperatures associated with the dry season. These results suggest the importance of thermoregulation in extreme heat for all individuals, and specifically for lactating females with nursing infants that likely experience higher metabolic and hydration stress. This study provides insight into the dynamics of primate cave use by contributing evidence that chimpanwe cave use may be influenced by reproductive states in addition to thermoregulatory needs.",International Journal of Primatology,41,,,,,10.1007/s10764-020-00165-4,

Among other initiatives, the use of exotic dairy cattle has been promoted, despite no evidence for the potential liveli-hood benefits (or otherwise) to smallholder farmers on adopting the new genetics. The current work fills this evidence gap by performing a farm-level economic study comparing the keeping of different breed and cross-breed types of dairy cattle under different management levels. Data for the study were obtained by monitoring 220 smallholder dairy cattle farms, with a combined cattle population of about 3,000 animals, over an almost 2-yr period. Findings of the study suggest that the most net-beneficial and cost-beneficial dairy cattle enterprise that could be used by the smallholder farmers was to keep crossbred indigenous zebu by exotic Bos taurus animals under management standards that are consid-ered good compared with local standards. This dairy enterprise type was 7.4-fold more net beneficial and had a 1.4-fold more favorable cost-benefit ratio than the traditional system of keeping indigenous zebu animals under poor (low-input) management. Interestingly, the keeping of (near) pure B. taurus dairy cattle resulted in the highest milk yields and thus benefit from milk, but was not the most net beneficial due to the high costs of keeping these animals, particularly in terms of feed. We also found that increasing the managementlevel of any of the breed or cross-breed types under consideration, including the indigenous zebu animals, resulted in an increased net benefit of 2.2-to 2.9-fold. Results of this economic analysis are discussed as part of a broader trade-off analysis, resulting in recommendations to strengthen the Senegal dairy sector. The combined intervention of improved dairy cattle genetics and management is considered a promising intervention to improve livelihoods of the rural poor as well as livestock production self-sufficiency for Senegal; some other system constraints are addressed.",Journal of Dairy Science,103,,,,,10.3168/jds.2019-17334,

As referential models, apes provide insight into the evolution of hominin hunting, given their phylogenetic relatedness and challenges reconstructing extinct hominin behaviour from palaeoanthropological evidence. Among chimpanzees, adult males are usually the main hunters, capturing vertebrate prey by hand. Savannah chimpanzees (P. t. verus) at Fongoli, Senegal are the only known non-human population that systematically hunts vertebrate prey with tools, making them an important source for hypotheses of early hominin behaviour based on analogy. Here, we test the hypothesis that sex and age patterns in tool-assisted hunting (n = 308 cases) at Fongoli occur and differ from chimpanzees elsewhere, and we compare tool-assisted hunting to the overall hunting pattern. Males accounted for 70\% of all captures but hunted with tools less than expected based on their representation on hunting days. Females accounted for most tool-assisted hunting. We propose that social tolerance at Fongoli, along with the tool-assisted hunting method, permits individuals other than adult males to capture and retain control of prey, which is uncommon for chimpanzees.

Damming of the Senegal River for irrigation purposes in the 1980s induced ecological changes that resulted in a large outbreak of Schistosoma mansoni, followed a few years later by an increase and spread of Schistosoma haematobium infections. The presence of hybrid crosses between the human and cattle schistosomes, S. haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, respectively, is adding complexity to the disease epidemiology in this area, and questions the strength of the species boundary between these two species. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of S. haematobium, S. bovis and their hybrids along the Senegal River basin using both microsatellite genetic markers and analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Human schistosome populations with a S. haematobium cox1 mtDNA profile and those with a S. bovis cox1 mtDNA profile (the so-called hybrids) appear to belong to a single randomly mating population, strongly differentiated from the pure S. bovis found in cattle. These results suggest that, in northern Senegal, a strong species boundary persists between human and cattle schistosome species and there is no prolific admixing of the populations. In addition, we found that in the SRB S. haematobium was spatially more differentiated in comparison to S. mansoni. This may be related either to the presence and susceptibility of the intermediate snail hosts, or to the colonisation history of the parasite.Copyright © 2019",International Journal for Parasitology,49,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.08.004,

I predicted that apes would be more active at night during periods of greater lunar illuminosity given diurnal primates' lack of visual specializations for low-light conditions and in dry season months when water scarcity exacerbated heat stress. Materials and MethodsI observed chimpanzees for 403 hrs on 40 nights between 2007 and 2013 and categorized their activity as social, movement, or vocalization. I scored their activity as occurring after moonrise or before moonset and considered the influence of moon phase (fuller versus darker phases) as well as season on chimpanzee nocturnal behavior in the analyses. ResultsResults indicate that apes were more active after moonrise or before moonset during fuller moon phases in the dry season but not the wet season. Most night-time activity involved movement (travel or forage), followed by social behavior, and long-distance vocal communication. DiscussionAnimals in highly seasonal habitats often exhibit thermoregulatory adaptations but, like other primates, chimpanzees lack physiological mechanisms to combat thermal stress. This study provides evidence that they may exhibit behaviors that allow them to avoid high temperatures in a savanna environment, such as feeding and socializing at night during the hottest time of year and in the brightest moon phases.

The use of vocalisations as a primary mode of communication has been the focus of much research, especially in attempts to understand the origins of human language, with a major focus on anthropoid primates and diurnal lemurs. Over the last decade, technological advances have allowed researchers to begin to conduct in-depth investigations into the communication systems exhibited by the nocturnal and cathemeral prosimian primates, including tarsiers, lemurs and lorises. Understanding how nocturnal prosimians use visual, olfactory and auditory cues is vital for reconstructing the origins of primate communication systems. In this special issue, we highlight some of the more exciting advances in the communication strategies of the prosimians. Contributions come from work conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Rwanda, Madagascar and the Indonesian islands of Java and Sulawesi. Topics will include: the description of novel ultrasonic vocalisations, including frequency and function of these newly discovered calls; the possible use of vocalisations to navigate and assemble at sleep sites; the importance of species-specific contact vocalisations for the identification of new species; the use of urinary and glandular signals to communicate and the methods developed to understand this complex communication in the field; the use of vocalisations for niche separation among nocturnal primates from mainland Africa and Madagascar; and whether or not we can use new technologies to discern whether prosimians use vocalisations for individual identification of group members.

Data relevant to addressing this deficiency (dental casts, photographs, and somatic measurements) were collected during the trapping of 267Guinea baboons in the Department of Kedougou, southeastern Senegal, as part of a 1 ong-term study of sylvatic, mosquito-borne viruses. Relative ages of the baboons were assessed through a combination of dental eruption and tooth-wear patterns. All age groups occurred in the sample, indicating they represent a reasonable cross-section of the population. The dental eruption sequence for Guinea baboons was found to differ somewhat from both yellow and olive baboons, as upper 12 emerges only after lower 12 is completely erupted. In male Guinea baboons, upper P3 erupts after both M2s are fully erupted, but in yellow and olive baboons both P3s erupt isochronally with M2. Male Guinea baboons are more similar to yellow than to olive baboons in having upper canines erupt after lower P3, and lower M3 before upper M3. Plots of body weight and other measurements against age demonstrate female progenesis, with females ceasing their growth at about age five and males continuing to grow until about age eight, similar to other baboons. At age eight, body weight sexual dimorphism is high, with males (n=15) averaging 19.05 kg and females (n=13) averaging 10.92 kg. Measurements for all body proportions were found to be less in the oldest members of the sample, possibly tracking local climate history (severe drought) experienced during their developmental years.",American Journal of Physical Anthropology,147,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.22033,

Throughout its distribution area, the species is associated with humid habitats, flood plains and ponds, which make its current distribution highly fragmented. Knowing that humid and dry climatic phases regularly alternated along the Quaternary in West Africa, it can be postulated that the evolutionary history of the species and its genetic variation largely reflect these climatic oscillations. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of M. huberti populations across the totality of the species' geographical range (Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania). We found that cytochrome b sequence variation is partitioned into four divergent clades (mean Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances varying from 0.57 to 3.08\%) corresponding to distinct geographical regions. We dated the separation events of these clades between 0.93 and 0.17 million years ago, suggesting that M. huberti history was strongly influenced by the Quaternary climatic variations and related hydrographic network changes. Relationships between lineages and the partitioning of genetic diversity suggest the occurrence of two refuges along the Atlantic coast during arid periods. Moreover, the species' current range results from a stepwise colonization from west to east. M. huberti colonized recently the Inner Delta of Niger River in Mali, probably during a humid episode some 0.6 million years ago. Demographically stable and highly diversified populations were found in South Senegal and Guinea while populations in North Senegal and in Mali experienced low numbers followed by a demographic expansion during the African Humid Period (c. 14 800-5500 BP). During the last arid period (c. 23 000-18 000 years ago), Malian populations found refuge in the northern parts of the Inner Delta of the Niger River, then expended to the southern parts of the delta and along the course of the Niger River downstream Tombouctou. More recently, M. huberti would have rapidly expanded into irrigated areas along the Senegal River and along the Canal du Sahel, Mali, reflecting the invasive and the pest character of this species.",Molecular Ecology,17,1994,2005,longitudinal_study,senegal,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03610.x,

The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal DNA, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial DNA, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife,8,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.02.003,

Much of the information derives from a questionnaire sent to all African territories in 1950. The annual incidence of plague in Africa declined, particularly from 1946 onwards. In 1949, under 400 cases were reported, as compared with over 6,000 in 1935. By the end of 1949, plague was still active in the Belgian Congo, Kenya and Tanganyika, Madagascar, and southern Africa. No cases were reported from Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, or Uganda during 1949. A comparison of the seasonal incidence of plague with prevailing atmospheric conditions (temperature and rainfall) in African territories shows that human plague is more frequent in warm moist weather-60 degrees -80 degrees F (15 degrees -27 degrees C)-than in hot dry, or cold, weather-over 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) or under 60 degrees F (15 degrees C). The highlands of equatorial Africa and of Madagascar appear to provide the optimum environment for the persistence of plague on the domestic (murine) plane and the high-veld and Kalahari of southern Africa on the sylvatic plane. The rat (Rattus rattus) and the multimammate mouse (R. (Mastomys) natalensis) and their fleas Xenopsylla brasiliensis and X. cheopis appear to be mainly responsible for the persistence of the reservoir in the East African highlands; R. rattus and X. cheopis play this role in Madagascar. The gerbils (Tatera and Desmodillus) and their burrow fleas X. philoxera and X. piriei are the main reservoirs of plague in southern Africa.

About half (51.6\%) of 639 sheep were positive, with seroprevalence rates per site varying between 6.9\% and 100\%. The highest seroprevalence was detected in the western part of the country (88.1\% in the Western Division and 62.1\% in the Lower River Division). Sheep in the two easterly divisions (Central River and Upper River divisions) showed the lowest seroprevalence of 29.3\% and 32.4\%, respectively, while those in the North Bank Division showed an intermediate prevalence of 40.6\%. In goats, less than one-third (30.3\%) of 679 animals tested were positive. The highest seroprevalence was detected in goats in the North Bank Division (59\%) and Western Division (44.1\%).

They are Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, and non-spore-forming rods. Both produce D/L lactic acid via homofermentative pathway. Growth of the strains occurred between 15 degrees C and 44 degrees C. The optimum temperature for growth was in 30 degrees C- 37 degrees C temperature and pH 3-8 range. Desiccation treatment in glycerol showed 30\% survival rates. Complex total fatty acid pattern of the strains showed the presence of C-14: 0, C-16: 0, C-16: 1, C-18: 0, C-18: 1, C-18: 2, C-18: 3.

Gambian giant pouched rats shifted from a domestic pet to invading species after suspected release from a pet breeder. Because of the large size of Gambian rats (weighing up to 2.8 kg), they pose a serious threat to native species (particularly nesting species) and agricultural crops, especially if Gambian rats invade mainland Florida. Also, Gambian rats pose a threat from disease, as they were implicated in a monkeypox outbreak in the midwestern United States in 2003. The United States Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services has initiated eradication and detection efforts in the Florida Keys, but trapping the sparse population of Gambian rats has proven difficult., RESULTS: Fifteen attractants that could be used in traps for capturing or detecting single or paired Gambian rats were tested. It was found that conspecific scents (i.e. feces and urine) from other Gambian rats were the best treatment for attracting single and paired Gambian rats. Single Gambian rats explored more attractant types than paired Gambian rats., CONCLUSIONS: Effective attractants for use with Gambian rats have been identified, and multiple attractant types should be used to capture or detect the sparse population.

As efforts to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem and interrupt transmission gather momentum, the potential zoonotic risk posed by livestock Schistosoma species via viable hybridisation in sub-Saharan Africa have been largely overlooked. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, distribution, and multi-host, multiparasite transmission cycle of Haematobium group schistosomiasis in Senegal, West Africa. Method(s): In this epidemiological study, we carried out systematic surveys in definitive hosts (humans, cattle, sheep, and goats) and snail intermediate hosts, in 2016-18, in two areas of Northern Senegal: Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, where transmission is perennial; and Barkedji and Linguere, where transmission is seasonal. The occurrence and distribution of Schistosoma species and hybrids were assessed by molecular analyses of parasitological specimens obtained from the different hosts. Children in the study villages aged 5-17 years and enrolled in school were selected from school registers. Adults (aged 18-78 years) were self-selecting volunteers. Livestock from the study villages in both areas were also randomly sampled, as were post-mortem samples from local abattoirs. Additionally, five malacological surveys of snail intermediate hosts were carried out at each site in open water sources used by the communities and their animals. Finding(s): In May to August, 2016, we surveyed 375 children and 20 adults from Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, and 201 children and 107 adults from Barkedji and Linguere; in October, 2017, to January, 2018, we surveyed 386 children and 88 adults from Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, and 323 children and 85 adults from Barkedji and Linguere. In Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in children was estimated to be 87\% (95\% CI 80-95) in 2016 and 88\% (82-95) in 2017-18. An estimated 63\% (in 2016) and 72\% (in 2017-18) of infected children were shedding Schistosoma haematobium-Schistosoma bovis hybrids. In adults in Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers, the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was estimated to be 79\% (52-97) in 2016 and 41\% (30-54) in 2017-18, with 88\% of infected samples containing S haematobium-S bovis hybrids. In Barkedji and Linguere the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in children was estimated to be 30\% (23-38) in 2016 and 42\% (35-49) in 2017-18, with the proportion of infected children found to be shedding S haematobium-S bovis hybrid miracidia much lower than in Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers (11\% in 2016 and 9\% in 2017-18). In adults in Barkedji and Linguere, the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was estimated to be 26\% (17-36) in 2016 and 47\% (34-60) in 2017-18, with 10\% of infected samples containing S haematobium-S bovis hybrids. The prevalence of S bovis in the sympatric cattle population of Richard Toll and the Lac de Guiers was 92\% (80-99), with S bovis also found in sheep (estimated prevalence 14\% [5-31]) and goats (15\% [5-33]). In Barkedji and Linguere the main schistosome species in livestock was Schistosoma curassoni, with an estimated prevalence of 73\% (48-93) in sheep, 84\% (61-98) in goats and 8\% (2-24) in cattle. S haematobium-S bovis hybrids were not found in livestock. In Richard Toll and Lac de Guiers 35\% of infected Bulinus spp snail intermediate hosts were found to be shedding S haematobium-S bovis hybrids (68\% shedding S haematobium; 17\% shedding S bovis); however, no snails were found to be shedding S haematobium hybrids in Barkedji and Linguere (29\% shedding S haematobium; 71\% shedding S curassoni). Interpretation(s): Our findings suggest that hybrids originate in humans via zoonotic spillover from livestock populations, where schistosomiasis is co-endemic. Introgressive hybridisation, evolving host ranges, and wider ecosystem contexts could affect the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis and other pathogens, demonstrating the need to consider control measures within a On Health framework.

Understanding wildlife occurrence and mechanisms of persistence in these human-dominated landscapes is fundamental for developing effective conservation strategies. Methods. In this paper, we aim to review current knowledge on the distribution of three threatened primates in Guinea-Bissau and neighbouring regions, highlighting research gaps and identifying priority research and conservation action. We conducted a systematic literature review of primate studies from 1976 to 2016 in Guinea-Bissau, southern Senegal and western Guinea (Boke Region). We mapped historical observation records of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), Temmincks red colobus (Pilicolobus badius temminckii) and king colobus (Colobus polykomos), including our preliminary survey data from Dulombi, a newly established National Park (NP) in Guinea-Bissau. Results. We found 151 documents, including 87 journal articles, that contained field data on primates in this region. In Guinea-Bissau, nearly all studies focussed south of the Corubal River, including mainly Cantanhez, Cufada, and Boe NPs. In Senegal, most of the data came from Fongoli and Niokolo-Koba NP. In Boke (Guinea) studies are few, with the most recent data coming from Sangaredi. In Dulombi NP we recorded eight primate species, including chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus. Across the selected region, chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus were reported in eleven, twelve and seven protected areas, respectively. Discussion. Our study demonstrates large geographical research gaps particularly for the two colobines. For the first time after more than two decades, we confirm the presence of red colobus and king colobus north of the Corubal River in Guinea-Bissau. The little information available from large parts of the red colobus range raises questions regarding levels of population fragmentation in this species, particularly in Casamance and across northern Guinea-Bissau. There are still no records demonstrating the occurrence of king colobus in Senegal, and the presence of a viable population in north-eastern Guinea-Bissau remains uncertain. While the occurrence of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal is well documented, data from Boke (Guinea) are sparse and out-of-date. Our approach-the mapping of data gathered from a systematic literature review-allows us to provide recommendations for selecting future geographical survey locations and planning further research and conservation strategies in this region.",Peerj,6,2002,2012,longitudinal_study,senegal,10.7717/peerj.4847,

The PRA was then used in conjunction with gross margin analyses and discounted cash flows to assess the social, economic and technical constraints to the supplementation of cattle in The Gambia. The PRA survey indicated that cattle are primarily kept as a means of savings, Farmers placed a value on manure that equalled domestic milk consumption and exceeded that of milk sales. Equines, bulls, and cows in one district, were important for draught and transport; small ruminants were kept primarily, as an investment and for ceremonial purposes. The gross margin analyses of productivity responses indicated that supplementation is not financially attractive in the short-term, i.e. for a single lactation or fattening period. However, discounted cash flows demonstrated that supplementation is worthwhile in the long-term particularly for draught cattle where multiple benefits accrue. Adoption of long-term supplementation strategies in cows is further constrained by transport, feed availability and the distribution of costs and benefits between cattle owners and hired herdsman.

Treatments were randomised and follow up was performed at one and two weeks with repeat examination and blood samples. DNA was extracted from a subsection of the blood samples (n = 18) in a standard manner (Qiagen Maxi kit). PCR was performed with primers for Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax. The products were run on gel electrophoresis to identify positive samples. Result(s): Six hundred and seventy six equines were examined; 254 (145 donkeys and 109 horses) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and received trypanosomiasis treatment. PCV was significantly increased at 1 and 2 weeks post treatment for all groups (P {\textless} 0.001). The increase was most marked in Diminasan and Samorin.

Poultry can serve as a reservoir for Salmonella and cause food-borne infections in humans. This review describes Salmonella contamination of food, poultry, and the farming environment, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and serotypes of Salmonella, as well as the farming systems, antimicrobial use (AMU), hygiene, and husbandry conditions used to rear poultry in Africa. Using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analysis) guidelines, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases were searched using a set of predefined keywords. Full-length research articles in English were examined for the period 2010-2020 and relevant information extracted for the narrative synthesis. Of the articles that met the inclusion criteria, 63.1\% were conducted on farms and among households, while 36.9\% were undertaken at government-controlled laboratories, which quarantine imported birds, processing plants, and retail outlets. The farming systems were intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive. AMU was described in 11.5\% of the studies and varied within and across countries. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella isolates were detected in 30 studies and the prevalence ranged from 12.1\% in Zimbabwe to 100\% in Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. A total of 226 different Salmonella serotypes were reported. Twenty-four (19.7\%) of the studies reported food-borne Salmonella contamination in eggs, poultry, and poultry products at retail outlets and processing plants. The apparent extensive use of antimicrobials and circulation of MDR Salmonella isolates of various serotypes in Africa is a concern. It is important to implement stricter biosecurity measures on farms, regulate the use of antimicrobials and implement surveillance systems, in addition to food safety measures to monitor the quality of poultry and poultry products for human consumption.© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",Microbial Drug Resistance,28,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/mdr.2021.0384,

We briefly review the worldwide status of the house mouse, with special focus on its situation in Africa. Focusing on Senegal, we then use historical records and a large body of spatio-temporal indoor trapping data obtained from small mammal communities over the last 30 years to analyse the invasion dynamics of the subspecies at the scale of the country. The geographic range of the invasive house mouse is surprisingly poorly known in Africa. In Senegal, we document a large range expansion of the subspecies in human settlements over the whole country within the last 30 years.

Here, we examined the function of meat sharing by Fongoli chimpanzees, a community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in southeastern Senegal.Materials and Methods: We tested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that have been used to explain patterns of food sharing: kin selection, generalized reciprocity, and meat-for-mating opportunities. We analyzed meat sharing events (n = 484) resulting from hunts, along with data on copulations, age-sex class, and kinship to determine which variables predict the likelihood of meat sharing during this study period (2006-2019).Results: We found full or partial support for kin selection, direct reciprocity, and meat-for-mating-opportunities. However, the analyses reveal that reciprocity and a mother/offspring relationship were the strongest predictors of whether or not an individual shared meat.Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the complexity of chimpanzee meat sharing behaviors, especially at a site where social tolerance offers increased opportunities for meat sharing by individuals other than dominant males. These findings can be placed in a referential model to inform hypotheses about the sensitivity of food sharing to environmental pressures, such as resource scarcity in savanna landscapes.",American Journal of Biological Anthropology,182,,,,,10.1002/ajpa.24815,

We reconstruct periodicity and duration of rLEH in canine teeth from three recently deceased chimpanzees from Fongoli, Senegal with a marked seven-month dry season. High-resolution dental molds were taken in the field for magnified imaging with digital microscopy. Photomontages allowed counting of perikymata between episodes of rLEH for reconstruction of periodicity and duration of physiological stress. Where rLEH spans the imbricational enamel, the number of events is consistent with years required to form canine imbricational enamel; i.e., periodicity of rLEH seems circannual. We predicted perikymata counts between rLEH events ranging from 52 to 61 based on reported long counts of 76 days. Counts ranged from 29.5 to 44, individual mean of 36.7. This discrepancy could be explained by recurrent stress with a periodicity of 7.28.4 months, or by long counts of 10 days per stria. Neither is supported in the literature. Since we find evidence of rLEH with circannual periodicity, we postulate the existence of non-emergent imbricational striae. Based on evidence that stress at Fongoli recurs annually, we reconstruct stress duration of 23 months, longer than reported for chimpanzees living in other habitats, which we attribute to heat stress and food shortage near shrinking waterholes. We conclude that canine teeth from a small mortality cohort of chimpanzees at Fongoli preserve a faithful record of dry season stress in an extreme environment. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

For the three species the litter size at birth in captivity is lower than the number of embryos recorded from pregnant females in the field. The sex-ratio at birth and weaning is not different from 1/1. The other reproductive characteristics can be summarized for each species as follows M. erythroleucus females, after a 21-day gestation period, give birth to 7.1 individuals, 80 \% of which survive to weaning. The mean interval between two successive litters is about 61 days. For M. huberti females, the lengh of the gestation period is about 22 days. The mean litter size is about 6.4 and 72 \% of newborn survive to weaning. Sixty eight days separate two successive litters. M. natalensis females, after a 21-day gestation period, produce about 6.5 young individuals every 53 days and only 50 \% of them survive to weaning.

The model uses data collected specifically for this study, such as the prevalence and level of bacteria on the neck skin of chickens bought in Dakar markets, time-temperature profiles recorded from purchase to consumption, an observational survey of meal preparation in private kitchens, and detection and enumeration of pathogens on kitchenware and cooks' hands. Thorough heating kills all bacteria present on chicken during cooking, but cross-contamination of cooked chicken or ready-to-eat food prepared for the meal via kitchenware and cooks' hands leads to a high expected frequency of pathogen ingestion. Additionally, significant growth of Salmonella is predicted during food storage at ambient temperature before and after meal preparation. These high exposures lead to a high estimated risk of campylobacteriosis and/or salmonellosis in Dakar households. The public health consequences could be amplified by the high level of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella and Campylobacter observed in this setting. A significant decrease in the number of ingested bacteria and in the risk could be achieved through a reduction of the prevalence of chicken contamination at slaughter, and by the use of simple hygienic measures in the kitchen.

Illiteracy level was high, and only 38\% indicated that they attended certain schools. There was a significant relationship (p{\textless}0.05) and phi coefficient of 0.35 between household heads' education status and record keeping. None of the examined management practices had a statistically significant relationship (p{\textgreater}0.05) with household heads' gender. Children (10-14years) were mostly responsible for providing care to the chickens. Foundation and replacement stocks were mainly acquired through purchase (78\%). Many households (74\%) indicated supplementary feeding of their flocks but only 34\% provided separate houses apart from the household dwellings. Newcastle (68\%) was the most common disease. Sick birds were recognized by restlessness (34\%) and diarrhea (28\%). External parasites were mainly controlled through local practices (52\%) while the most common way to dispose dead birds was to throw them away (88\%). Up to 90\% indicated no formal training on disease management and access to extension agents was also low (20\%). Control of chicken movement was occasionally done to protect birds from predators (60\%) and then, to avoid contagious diseases (38\%).

Their main goal for selling livestock and animal products consists in making money to cover their usual expenses and to ensure their food safety. Based on primary data obtained through investigations in Ferlo encampments throughout a whole year (winter 2005 - winter 2006), a progressive decomposition of their trade incomes shows that the drillings, often considered by policies as an element which structures the pastoral activity, does not systematically improve the money holdings. The released incomes are related to the marketing of ruminants (97.9\% of the livestock farming income with the bovines contributing for 40\% and small ruminants for 60\%). The sale of dairy by-products (fresh and curdled milk, butter) remain marginal (0.50\%) and are conversely linked to the degree of enclosure of the herders' places of residence and activity. The diversification of production and the activities is not apparent in the activities of selling.

The aim of this study was to examine chimpanzees' nesting habits in terms of the tree species utilized and sleeping nest heights. We recorded a total of 550 chimpanzee nests at Bagnomba between January 2015 and December 2015. The chimpanzees here made nests in particular tree species more often than others. The majority of nests (63\%) were in two tree species: Diospyros mespiliformis and Pterocarpus erinaceus. The average height of nesting trees was 10.54 m (SD 3.91, range, 0.0-29.0 m) and average nest height was 7.90 m (SD 3.62, range, 0.0-25.0 m). The result of a linear regression analysis (r = 0.7874; n = 550; p {\textless} 0.05) is consistent with a preference for nesting at a particular height. Bagnomba chimpanzees rarely made ground nests (0.36\% of nests), but the presence of any ground nesting was unexpected, given that at least one leopard (Panthera pardus) also occupied the hill.

The morbidity and mortality inflicted upon livestock in sub-Saharan Africa has been largely overlooked, in part due to a lack of validated sensitive and specific tests, which do not require specialist training or equipment to deliver and interpret. Inexpensive, noninvasive, and sensitive diagnostic tests for livestock-use would also facilitate both prevalence mapping and appropriate intervention programmes. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the currently available point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (POC-CCA), designed for Schistosoma mansoni detection in humans, for the detection of intestinal livestock schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. POC-CCA, together with the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) test, miracidial hatching technique (MHT) and organ and mesentery inspection (for animals from abattoirs only), were applied to samples collected from 195 animals (56 cattle and 139 small ruminants (goats and sheep) from abattoirs and living populations) from Senegal. POC-CCA sensitivity varied by ruminant group and by location/parasite species: sensitivity was greater in Barkedji (cattle: mean 81\% (95\% credible interval (CrI): 55\%-98\%); small ruminants: 49\% (29\%-87\%), where livestock were primarily infected by S. curassoni, than in Richard Toll (cattle: 62\% (41\%-84\%); small ruminants: 12\% (1\%-37\%), where S. bovis was the main parasite species. Mean POC-CCA specificity across sites in small ruminants was 91\% (77\%-99\%) with little variation between locations/parasites (Barkedji: 91\% (73\%-99\%); Richard Toll: 88\% (65\% - 99\%). Specificity could not be assessed in cattle owing to the low number of uninfected cattle surveyed. Overall, our results indicate that, whilst the current POC-CCA does represent a potential diagnostic tool for animal schistosomiasis, future work is needed to develop a livestock-specific affordable and field-applicable diagnostic tests to enable determination of the true extent of livestock schistosomiasis.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study compares the behavior of captive-born Galago senegalensis braccatus, the Senegal galago, from 1 to 20 weeks of age for 3-5 females and 4-6 males. The subjects lived in social groups, onfa reversed light cycle. Three 10-min focal samples were taken each week, for each subject, during each of the 6 most active hours of the waking cycle (night). Locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing analysis was used to test for sex differences in behavior. There were no sex differences in most forms of mother-offspring contact, including nursing, control of proximity with the mother or grooming. Females were more active than males in the rate of solitary acrobatic play and, only after the age of weaning, in locomotion. Altogether, these observations suggest that the sexes might not present more energetic 'costs' to mothers. There were tendencies for female immatures to play with the mother more than male immatures did, and a tendency for the males to investigate the cage more than the females. Male and female immatures groomed non-mother group mates in equivalent amounts. Since males are likely the dispersing sex in galagos, these differences might be reflective of later dispersal patterns. However, comparisons are needed with a female dispersal species (e.g. chimpanzees) to test this hypothesis. Alternative hypotheses concerning the 'cost' and/or'value' of sons versus daughters need to be explored. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Folia Primatologica,74,,,,,10.1159/000073315,

At the same time, a number of small mammal species, be they native or invasive, take advantage of human-induced habitat modifications. They represent commensal communities of organisms that cause a number of inconveniences to humans, including potential reservoirs of zoonotic diseases. We studied via live trapping and habitat characterization such commensal small mammal communities in small villages to large cities of Senegal, to try to understand how the species share this particular space. Seven major species were recorded, with exotic invasive house mice (Mus musculus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) dominating in numbers. The shrew Crocidura olivieri appeared as the main and more widespread native species, while native rodent species (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni) were less abundant and/or more localized. Habitat preferences, compared between species in terms of room types and characteristics, showed differences among house mice, black rats and M. natalensis especially. Niche (habitat component) breadth and overlap were measured. Among invasive species, the house mouse showed a larger niche breadth than the black rat, and overall, all species displayed high overlap values. Co-occurrence patterns were studied at the global and local scales. The latter show cases of aggregation (between the black rat and native species, for instance) and of segregation (as between the house mouse and the black rat in Tambacounda, or between the black rat and M. natalensis in Kedougou). While updating information on commensal small mammal distribution in Senegal, a country submitted to a dynamic process of invasion by the black rat and the house mouse, we bring original information on how species occupy and share the commensal space, and make predictions on the evolution of these communities in a period of ever-accelerating global changes. We present and analyse data on the distribution of commensal small mammals obtained via intensive trapping operation and habitat description in a series of localities in Senegal, with the aim to: (i) describe the community of small mammals living in contact with humans and evaluate the respective share that native and invasive species occupy with this community; (ii) better understand the factors that govern species distribution and co-occurrence of species using a series of analyses using habitat characteristics gathered at the moment of captures, in view of a better understanding of patterns and processes at work in a group of organisms of particular concern regarding their interactions with humans.image",Ecology and Evolution,13,2012,2015,longitudinal_study,senegal,10.1002/ece3.10539,

The aim of our study was to determine the factors underlying these phases of increased rodent abundance over a ten-year (2008 to 2019) sampling period during the hot dry season (February-May). A total of 1,867 rodents of four species were captured, among which Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti dominated. Our results showed that, during this season, rodent abundance (i) increases significantly with rainfall from the previous year, (ii) is higher in cultivated than in uncultivated plots, (iii) increases with plant cover, (iv) increases, for M. huberti, with the presence of open water. We showed that in an area that was first sparsely cultivated and then impacted by hydro-agricultural rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, the abundance of A. niloticus changed following this program, reaching the level of a nearby area that has been intensively cultivated for decades. Moreover, we showed that the proportion of adults among the captured individuals was lower in rice plots than in vegetable gardening fields and uncultivated plots. The breeding pattern of adult individuals was also affected by land use. Results suggest that uncultivated areas and vegetable gardening fields constitute refuge and breeding ground hotspots and would thus form a starting point for the invasion of rice fields.

Most of the dog population is of local and young (average age 29 months). Males are preferred over females. The dogs belong to youths or adolescents who are without means and can neither feed the dogs correctly nor look after them when they fall sick. This individual poverty explains why the dogs are not vaccinated and why they scavenge for survival, thus contacting permanent strays, walking real reservoirs of rabies virus!

We conducted a spatial risk assessment of RVF in Senegal using serologic data from 16,738 animals in 211 locations. Bayesian spatial regression models were developed with interpolated seasonal rainfall, land surface temperature, distance to perennial water bodies, and time of year entered as fixed-effect variables. Average total monthly rainfall during December-February was the most important spatial predictor of risk of positive RVF serologic status. Maps derived from the models highlighted the lower Senegal River basin and the southern border regions of Senegal as high-risk areas. These risk maps are suitable for use in planning improved sentinel surveillance systems in Senegal, although further data collection is required in large areas of Senegal to better define the spatial distribution of RVF.","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",7,,,,,,

Nineteen villages and 76 herds were involved in the experiment. Villages were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment combinations in a factorial design, and subsequent demographic rates and net offtake patterns were measured. in the trial, vaccination had a negative effect on offtakes among females. No vaccination effect was observed for males. A positive effect of deworming was found for both sexes. From the trial data, our model calculated that the overall ratio of offtakes (i.e. number of animals) for dewormed over undrenched sheep was 1.2 (95\% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.4).

Scientific and socio-economic interests in the GCR have led to heightened research efforts targeted towards a better understanding of its biology and exploration of its economic and translational usefulness. METHOD(S): Records of all online scientific publications on the GCR from Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, science.gov, Ebscohost and Worldwide science, with the exception of research theses, proceedings, unpublished projects and abstracts, were collated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULT(S): A total of 146 published scholarly articles spanning about six decades were retrieved, with 98\% of the GCR publications originating from African countries. Nigeria boasts the highest number of publications (58.22\%) followed by Ghana (21.23\%) and South Africa (5.48\%) while Senegal contributed the least (0.69\%). Publications were sorted into ten field categories. The field with the highest number of articles (41.78\%) was animal breeding and management recording, closely followed by anatomy (37.67\%). Lesser contributions were made by parasitology (5.48\%), biochemistry/hematology (4.8\%), pharmacology/toxicology (4.11\%), pathology (2.06\%), and surgery/anesthesia and physiology (1.37\% apiece). The fields with fewest contributions were microbiology and developmental biology (0.69\% each). CONCLUSION(S): This study chronicles the spectrum of knowledge available on the GCR, highlighting the knowledge gap that still exists in various fields in order to provide advocacy for new frontiers in research efforts on this rodent. We suggest the need for a clearly defined and well integrated national/regional policy aimed at establishing Africa's foremost micro-livestock rodent, the greater cane rat, on the world's scientific radar.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

We surveyed the West African chimpanzees outside protected areas in the Kedougou region of southeastern Senegal between November 2014 and July 2015 using recce walks (n = 57, totalling 300 km of pedestrian survey distance) in potential chimpanzee habitats. We recorded direct observations of chimpanzees or indices of chimpanzee activity, such as sleeping nests, footprints and faeces. We accumulated 21 direct contacts with chimpanzees and recorded 3489 chimpanzee nests. We mapped the distribution of chimpanzee sleeping sites and indicators of anthropogenic activity by regional administrative units to facilitate species management and conservation planning in the immediate future. In addition, we identified the habitats and tree species used by chimpanzees to construct their nests in order to explore nesting tree preferences. Chimpanzees used almost 40 tree species in the Kedougou region but 84\% of nests were associated with eight tree species, namely Pterocarpus erinaceus. Diospyros mespiliformis, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Hexalobus monopetalus, Cola cordifolia, Lannea sp., Parkia biglobosa and Piliostigma thonningii. Among these eight nesting tree species, 60\% of the corresponding nests were located in three species: P. erinaceus, D. mespiliformis and A. leiocarpus.

The objective of our study was to estimate these measures of ""longitudinal aspects"" of diagnostic performance and to investigate potential biological factors. Emphasis was on diagnosis at the genus level (Trypanosoma spp.). Twelve N'Dama, 12 Gobra zebu and 12N'DamaxGobra (F1) crossbred cattle (all animals non-infected at the start of the experiment, six male and six female animals in each cohort) were exposed to natural high tsetse challenge in the Niamina East area in The Gambia [Acta Trop. 71 (1998) 57]. The animals were investigated parasitologically (detection of trypanosomes by buffy-coat technique), serologically (detection of T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and clinically (packed-cell volume, PCV) over a period of 180 days. The time-to-first detection of trypanosomes, trypanosomal antigen (cut-off as suggested by test supplier) and drop in PCV (subject-based cut-off values) were recorded as outcomes of interest. Thus, incidence was both parasitologically (I(p)), serologically (I(s)) and clinically (I(c)). Recurrent events were not considered. The TD between first parasitological and first serological detection was established as I(s) time minus I(p) time. The effect of breed and sex on the time-to-first detection and on TD was investigated using Cox (proportional hazard) regression and ANOVA, respectively. We found that time-to-first parasitological detection of trypanosomosis in N'Dama animals was significantly longer than in the two other breeds (Cox regression, P=0.002). A similar but less-strong (P=0.063) effect of breed on time-to-first detection of trypanosomal antigen was found, whereas no breed effect was observed for clinical detection (P=0.432). Sex had no effect in all detection systems. The TD varied between -56 and 115 (mean 28). Marked differences among breeds and between sexes were not observed (ANOVA, P=0.8). We suggest that incidence studies are more suitable for detecting risk factors for animal trypanosomosis than prevalence-based (cross-sectional) studies because the latter often result in misinterpretation of factors that increase the survival time with infection as risk factors.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,51,,,,,,

Eight treatment combinations were formed in which the two breeds were balanced. Pyrexia was observed following trypanosome infection and was not different between the two breeds. However, a significant higher parasitaemia level, a shorter prepatent period and a lower antibody response in the crossbreds following infection, indicated a significant reduction of the trypanotolerance and confirmed the genetic origin of the trait. Neither helminth infection nor dietary level influenced the onset and level of parasitaemia or the level of antibody response following trypanosome infection. Trypanosome infection, helminth infection and low supplementary feeding caused independently significant reductions in PCV level and weight gain but these declines were not worse in crossbreds as compared to Djallonke. Independently, of the studied factors, crossbreds were generally heavier than Djallonke and also grew faster, especially during the second phase of the study. Crossbreds had significantly higher mean nematode egg output (epg) compared to Djallonke sheep but reduction of epg following deworming was similar in both breeds. The lower epg in the Djallonke breed indicated an innate resistance to helminths and/or more efficient immune response. Trypanosome infection tended to increase epg, confirming the immunosuppressive effect of the former. The higher body temperature in the Djallonke compared to crossbreds suggested a better heat tolerance in the former breed. From this study it was concluded that Djallonke-Sahelian crossbred sheep inspite of a reduced trypanotolerance and lower resistance to helminth infection, posses a higher potential to intensify mutton production as compared to the pure Djallonke.

The experimental herd was divided in five groups each composed of five randomly selected animals. Group 1 was challenged with T. congolense, Group 2 with T. vivax, Group 3 was inoculated with T. congolense followed by a cross-superchallenge with T. vivax, Group 4 was inoculated with T. vivax followed by T. congolense cross-superchallenge. Animals in Group 5 were used as controls. Both T. vivax and T. congolense cross-superchallenges were carried out on Day 14 subsequent to respective initial T. congolense and T. vivax inoculations. All challenges were performed by intradermal needle inoculation of stocks of trypanosome bloodstream forms. In challenged animals (Group 1 to 4), parasitaemia profiles and packed red cell volumes (PCV) were measured for four months. Weight changes were recorded monthly and daily weight gain (DWG) computed. All cattle challenged with T. congolense became parasitaemic. Conversely, one animal in Group 2 and two in Group 3 never displayed patent T. vivax parasitaemia. Both in single (Group 1), initial (Group 3) and cross-superchallenged (Group 4) cattle higher percentage of positive blood samples and higher parasitaemia level were obtained following T. congolense than T. vivax inocula (Group 2, 3 and 4) (P{\textless}0.04 or greater). Overall the pre-challenge period, PCV values and DWGs were nearly identical in the five groups. Conversely, over the post-challenge period, cattle singly, initially and cross-superinoculated with T. congolense (Group 1, 3 and 4) displayed lower PCV values and DWGs in comparison with both control animals (Group 5) and with singly T. vivax challenged cattle (Group 2) (P{\textless}0.05 or greater). No difference in mean PCV levels and DWGs was found between animals in Group 2 and cattle in Group 5. It was concluded that trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle suffered more from T. congolense and mixed T. congolensel T. vivax infections, while pure T. vivax infection did not produce appreciable negative effects on their health and productivity. Therefore, considering that tsetse and trypanosomosis control campaigns are costly and are justified only when derived economic benefits exceed those of control, and also that an ample mosaic of farming systems exists in West Africa, species-specific trypanosome prevalence and relative impact should be assessed in various cattle populations and breeds differing in trypanosome susceptibility before advising any intervention. Moreover, virulence and related effects of T. congolense and T. vivax endemic stocks on health and productivity in local cattle populations should also be estimated in order to counsel appropriate economic protection measures against trypanosmosis, i.e. vector control and/or strategic use of trypanocidal drugs.",Veterinary Parasitology,86,,,,,,

The level of anaemia caused by the trypanosome infection was similar in the two breeds during the trial. Based on these findings, no difference in tolerance or susceptibility to T. congolense could be demonstrated between the WAD goats and their Saanen crosses.

In order to define the extent of the differences in susceptibility and productivity, 10 Zebu cows (a breed considered trypanosusceptible) and 10 N'Dama cows (a breed recognised for trypanotolerance) were exposed to a natural field challenge from Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead. The animals were two-and-a-half to three years old and had not been previously exposed to trypanosomiasis. All Zebu died of trypanosomiasis within eight months of first exposure. In contrast, only three N'Dama died of trypanosomiasis; they had all been suckling calves before they succumbed 11 to 14 months after initial exposure. The prevalence, level and duration of parasitaemia were significantly less in the N'Dama, which, unlike the Zebu, did not become febrile during parasitaemia. The differences in parasitaemia were largely attributable to Trypanosoma vivax. The N'Dama also developed much less severe anaemia than the Zebu. The mean and standard deviation of the packed red cell volume of the N'Dama was not significantly different between eight months after exposure when all Zebu were dead, and 21 months when the experiment was terminated. The relative productivity of the N'Dama was impressive. In addition to reduced mortality, the N'Dama experienced no abortions and produced five calves, three of which were alive at the end of the experiment, at which time three of the surviving N'Dama were pregnant. In the Zebu, in marked contrast, abortions occurred both in early and late pregnancy and no live calves were produced.

The second part shifts to local-level perspectives on human-chimpanzee relationships, emphasizing the land rights contentions and misunderstandings created by the implementation of protected areas at Bossou and in the Bok, region of Guinea.

TMany Bartonella species are associated with human diseases. Rodent-associated species, such as B. elizabethae, B. grahamii and B. vinsonii are human pathogens. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents from Senegal were carried out and the only West African country where it was performed is Nigeria. Methods \& Materials: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents in Sine-Saloum region of Senegal where rodents and are reservoirs rodent-associated soft ticks are vectors of relapsing fever caused by Borrelia crocidurae. Rodents and insectivores were captured alive in February 2013 in two sites (Dielmo and Ndiop) using wire mesh traps baited with peanut butter or onions. Trapped rodents and insectivores were anaesthetized and opened in sterile conditions. Blood was inoculated on Columbia agar plates (5\% sheep blood). The gltA, rpoB, 16S rRNA, ftsZ genes and ITS were amplified and sequenced from recovered Bartonella isolates. Result(s): In total, during the period of 6 days 119 small mammals were captured: 116 rodents and 3 shrews (Crocidura cf. olivieri). Rodents were identified morphologically: 5 Arvicantis niloticus, 56 Gerbilliscus gambianus, 49 Mastomys erythroleucus, 5 Mus musculus and 1 Praomys daltoni. 30 isolates of Bartonella spp. were recovered from the blood of rodents. None of the isolated belonged to already described species of Bartonella. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolated bartonellae form three separate clusters within the genus Bartonella. Comparison of gltA genes of recovered isolated with those of officially recognized species allowed to conclude that three clusters may present three separate new species of Bartonella. Candidatus ""Bartonella raoultii"" (1 isolate) and Candidatus ""Bartonella mastomydis"" (21 isolates) were recovered only from Mastomys erythroleucus, Candidatus ""Bartonella saheliensis"" (8 isolates) were recovered only from Gerbilliscus gambianus. Conclusion(s): Rodents in Senegal are not only reservoirs of the agent of relapsing fever, but also of three new Bartonella species. The pathogenicity for humans of these isolates is yet to be investigated. Unlike other African countries, each genetic cluster of bartonellae from Senegalese rodents is associated with a specific rodent species.",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,21,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.03.1112,

Data were collected via surveys implemented within three study sites in The Gambia, where traditional mixed crop-livestock smallholder farming predominates. The surveys comprised a participatory rural appraisal conducted in nine communities and a household questionnaire targeting 238 households. Livestock-keeping households were classified as 'poorer' or 'wealthier' based on the number of cattle owned. The most important objectives for keeping all species of livestock for the poorer groups (0 to 10 cattle) was 'savings and insurance', followed by 'income' and 'ceremonial/dowry' for the small ruminants and 'manure' and 'draught' for both cows and bulls. In contrast, for the wealthier group (more than 10 cattle), savings and insurance was the fourth to seventh ranked production objective (depending on species), with the most important production objectives being ceremonial/dowry for goats, income for sheep and manure for cows and bulls. An analysis of breeding practices indicated that breeding animals are selected on criteria which partially align to the breeding objectives, animals are rarely purchased for the purpose of breed improvement, knowledge of the cause and consequence of inbreeding is low and breeding decision makers may not necessarily be the livestock owner, particularly if the livestock owner is a women. Given this, it is suggested that capacity building on breeding-related issues, particularly in relation to the selection of breeding animals and specifically targeted at the different socioeconomic groups of livestock keepers, may be an appropriate, effective and relatively low-cost breeding intervention.",Tropical Animal Health and Production,45,,,,,10.1007/s11250-012-0194-1,

Severe hypoglycaemia (0.12 g/l), anaemia (red blood cells 2.6 x 1012/l) and thrombocytopenia (45 x 109/ l) were diagnosed. The dog had just returned from a 6 month stay in Senegal and sub-Saharan Africa. A diagnosis of canine African trypanosomiasis was made. Material(s) and Method(s): Examination of blood smears, lymph node aspiration and PCR on whole blood. Result(s): Blood smears showed red blood cell anisocytosis and polychromasia, macrothrombocytes and numerous free protozoa were also recognized. The parasites were 10-20 mm in length, had a central nucleus, a medium-sized kinetoplast located at the margin of the body, just in front of the posterior extremity (marginal and subterminal kinetoplast), a poorly-developed undulating membrane and no free flagellum. This morphology is consistent with Trypanosoma congolense. Numerous trypanosomes were also present in the lymph node aspirate. PCR analysis revealed an infection with Trypanosoma congolense forest-type. Conclusion(s): The dog was chronically infected by Trypanosoma congolense forest-type. In cattle, strains of T. congolense differ greatly in virulence: T. congolense savannah-type produces rapidly fatal infection, T. congolense forest-type causes chronic infection and T. congolense kilifi-type produces inapparent infection.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,143,,,,,,

Trypanosoma vivax, one of the principal trypanosome species responsible for the disease, infects a wide host range including cattle, goats, horses and donkeys and is transmitted both cyclically by tsetse flies and mechanically by other biting flies, resulting in a distribution covering large swathes of South America and much of sub-Saharan Africa. While there is evidence for mating in some of the related trypanosome species, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma cruzi, very little work has been carried out to examine this question in T. vivax. Understanding whether mating occurs in T. vivax will provide insight into the dynamics of trait inheritance, for example the spread of drug resistance, as well as examining the origins of meiosis in the order Kinetoplastida. With this in mind we have identified orthologues of eight core meiotic genes within the genome, the presence of which imply that the potential for mating exists in this species. In order to address whether mating occurs, we have investigated a sympatric field population of T. vivax collected from livestock in The Gambia, using microsatellite markers developed for this species.

From these cattle, 12 animals of each breed were randomly selected and examined parasitologically for trypanosome infections and packed cell volume (PCV) twice a week (high surveillance, group HS). In the remaining 100 cattle trypanosome infection and PCV were monitored monthly (low surveillance, group LS). Mortality rates were recorded in both groups. Tick infestation was quantified fortnightly from all animals in group HS and from four to seven randomly selected animals of each breed in group LS. In both HS and LS groups, trypanocidal drug treatment was administered to trypanosome positive animals with PCV equal to or less than 20\% or when they showed clinical evidence (dullness, weight loss) of trypanosomosis. In both groups, N'Dama cattle exhibited a superior capacity to control trypanosome infections and limit tick burdens. Particularly, in group HS N'Dama cattle showed lower trypanosome infection rate, higher mean PCV value, lower requirement for trypanocide treatments and lower tick load than crossbred and Gobra cattle in the corresponding group (P {\textless} 0.05 or greater). This was also true in N'Damas in comparison with crossbreds in group LS. Unfortunately, the high mortality occurring in Gobra cattle in group LS did not allow within group comparative analysis between N'Dama, Gobra and crossbred cattle overall the study period. No death occurred in N'Dama cattle maintained under high surveillance of trypanosome infection, while approximately 8\% of crossbreds and 50\% of Gobras died of trypanosomosis. In group LS, all Gobra and more than 70\% of crossbred cattle died. In this group, mortality in N'Dama was limited to less than 16\%. In both groups, differences in mortality were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) in Gobras than in N'Damas. Within breed, animals of the three breeds maintained under high surveillance of trypanosomal infection showed higher mean PCV values, lower tick burdens and required proportionally less trypanocide treatments than corresponding cattle in group LS. The infection rate in N'Dama under high surveillance was lower in comparison with N'Dama cattle in group LS. There was no significant difference in mortality between groups within the N'Dama breed. Conversely, mortality rates were lower in crossbred and Gobra in group HS than in respective cattle in group LS. It was concluded that cattle of the three breeds suffered from trypanosomosis and that trypanosome infections affected tick susceptibility. However, N'Dama showed a superior ability to limit both the pathological effects of trypanosomosis and the level of tick infestations. Therefore, considering the cost of labour and consumable equipment required for a high surveillance, use of multi-disease resistant N'Dama cattle is recommended for the low-input traditional African farming systems in areas where trypanosomosis, ticks and tick-borne diseases are constraints to livestock production. Additional comparative investigations are needed to assess the impact of high surveillance scheme of trypanosome infection in different production systems in trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle exposed to different gradients of tsetse challenge.",Acta Tropica,71,1995,1995,cross_sectional,gambia,,

There was a strong correlation between prevalence and incidence of infection in the N'Dama. There was no correlation, however, between prevalence of infection in cattle and tsetse challenge unless the data were offset by 3-5 months.

A review of cases at The Gambian Horse and Donkey Trust (GHDT) indicated that a common reason for presentation is a poorly defined medical condition often attributed to trypanosomosis. There are few reports describing the prevalence or the range of clinical signs associated with infection with different species of trypanosomes in horses and donkeys, but given the importance of these animals, the role of trypanosomosis requires investigation., RESULTS: In total 241 animals from the Central River Division in The Gambia (183 horses and 58 donkeys) were screened using Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) followed by trypanosome species identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results indicated overall trypanosome prevalence of 91\%; with an infection rate of 31\% for Trypanosoma congolense Savannah, 87\% for Trypanosoma vivax and 18\% for Trypanosoma brucei sp. Multiple species were present in 43\% of infections. Microscopy had a good specificity (100\%) and positive predictive value (100\%) for trypanosome detection, but the sensitivity (20\%) and negative predictive value (10.5\%) were low relative to PCR-based diagnosis. Infection with T congolense showed the greatest negative effect on packed cell volume (PCV), while infection with T. brucei sp also had a significant, although lesser, negative effect on PCV. In addition, cases positive by microscopy were associated with significantly lower PCV. However, concurrent infection with T. vivax appeared to cause less effect on PCV, compared to animals infected with T. congolense alone., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Trypanosomosis was high in both horses and donkeys. Infection with T. congolense appeared to have the greatest clinical significance, while T. vivax infection may be of limited clinical significance in this population. Indeed, there is evidence of T. vivax co-infection ameliorating the pathology caused by T. congolense. WGA and PCR allowed a more comprehensive analysis of field infections with the detection of infections below the threshold of microscopy, and provided indications of interactions between parasite species that would otherwise remain undetected. The study raises important questions about the epidemiology of trypanosome infection in relation to disease that require a full scale longitudinal analysis.",Bmc Veterinary Research,4,2005,2005,cross_sectional,gambia,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-4-7,

Here, we used a rigorously predefined protocol to search and select eligible publications that utilized either microscopy, serology, or molecular methods to investigate prevalence of trypanosomosis based on the presence of any of three most common Trypanosoma spp. (T. congolense, T. vivax, and T. brucei) in the field-based naturally grazed Gambian cattle, sheep, and goats. To combine results of studies on cattle through meta-analysis, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out with the random effects model, and prevalence estimates of each study with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were presented with a forest plot. All the eligible studies utilized the buffy coat technique (BCT) to detect trypanosomes in the blood samples, while the more sensitive serological and molecular detection methods are yet to be widely exploited. Heterogeneity among the studies on cattle was moderate (I2 = 55\%), and the pooled trypanosomosis prevalence based on the BCT was 5.2\% (95\% CI: 4.0-6.4). Meanwhile, estimated prevalence varied according to the trypanosome detection methods, study locations, types of publication, year, and length of observations. We could not pool the trypanosomosis prevalence in sheep and goats through meta-analysis due to small number of studies. The prevalence estimates based on the BCT ranged from 3.2 to 8.1\% in goats and 2.8 to 10.6\% in sheep. Even though there seems to be a slight decrease in trypanosomosis prevalence in cattle in one of the Gambian districts, there was no consistent trend across the years.

In addition, the lack of understanding of the specific farmers' problems in their respective production systems by assuming homogeneity has led to inappropriate planning of interventions and inefficient utilization of resources. The variations in individual farming systems and local contexts require to understand each system separately to inform decision-makers and relevant stakeholders about specific entries of intervention for farmers based on customized needs.

This typology confirmed the co-existence of three livestock production cluster systems with differences and similarities in their production targets and quantities, market access, animal breeds, and the livestock management system of the animals. The studied region represented a new format of smallholder livestock development, where the implementation of a dairy processor and its milk collection centre created a new dynamic in production activities. Farmers confirmed that the extension services and a consistent market opportunity provided by the dairy processor increased local productivity and offered an alternative source of income but they have also reiterated concerns like the dairy processor's low milk buying prices which need to be addressed.

For the pastoralists, the well-being of their animals is the point of departure and mobility is used to ensure that the livestock are in good condition. The paper shows that it is important to distinguish between mobility of pastoralists and of their herd; even though the pastoralists of northern Senegal have become semi-sedentary, their herds are still quite mobile. The pastoralists are willing to move around within a small territory, which they consider their place, but are unwilling to employ large-scale mobility themselves. Mobility is not of importance for their ethnic identity and some use paid herders to care for their livestock.

The deltamethrin treatment led to a significant reduction in the average number of mosquitoes attracted by the treated-calf compared to the control during the first 2 weeks post-treatment both for all species and for the main vectors such as Ae. vexans, Ae. ochraceus, Cx. poicilipes, Cx. neavei and Ma. uniformis. However these means were comparable for the last two weeks post-treatment both for the whole mosquito fauna and the main vectors with the exception of Cx. neavei. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rates of engorged females during the first two weeks post-treatment. Indeed, the females' engorgement rate on the treated-calf compared to the control has been reduced by 57.3\% for Ae. vexans, 39.8\% for Ae. ochraceus, 76.4\% for Cx. poicilipes, 82.4\% for Cx. neavei, 84.6\% for Ma. uniformis and 64.1\% for the whole mosquito fauna. This effect of the treatment was maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment only for Cx. neavei. Mortality rates were higher among mosquitoes collected with the treated-calf compared to the control in the first fortnight of the test. This impact of the insecticide has been maintained in the second fortnight post-treatment excepted for Cx. neavei. However a significant variation of the mortality of the mosquitoes collected with the treated-cattle was observed between the two fortnights. In fact, the mortality rate of the mosquitoes collected on the treated-cattle decreased by 43.8\% for the mosquito fauna as a whole, 47.5\% for Cx. poicilipes and 82.4\% for Ae. vexans, 76\% for Ae. ochraceus, and 63.3\% for Ma. uniformis. No deviation of host-seeking mosquitoes, from treated calf to men, has been observed since the average number of host-seeking mosquitoes collected on men close to the two calves was statistically comparable. The insecticide-treated cattle may be a good method for controlling RVF and WN vectors and associated mosquitoes in Senegal. However there is a need to develop new formulations or new strategies of application that could improve the duration of the effectiveness of the treatment.",Utilisation de boeufs traites aux insecticides dans la lutte contre les vecteurs des virus de la fievre de la vallee du Rift et de la fievre West Nile au Senegal.,101,,,,,,

The estimated incidence rate in chickens was 14\% (95\% CI 7-29), with a very low level of transmission between July and September, and a transmission peak occurring between September and October. Comparing these results with the estimate obtained from a previous transversal serological study performed on horses the same year in the same area, the relevance of sentinel chickens in estimating the WNV transmission rate is highlighted. Conventionally adult mosquito populations disappear during the dry season but WN disease was shown to be endemic in the study area. The mechanisms of virus maintenance are discussed.",Epidemiology and Infection,136,,,,,,

Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of USUV involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: AF013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to USUV in both Africa and Europe.",Viruses,11,2012,2013,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v11020181,

We evaluated whether the host species have the same parasites and, within host species, whether the variability in parasite community is related to intrinsic (sex, age of the host individual) or extrinsic (habitat, season) factors. Arvicanthis niloticus was parasitized by 2 cestode species, namely Inermicapsifer madagascariensis and the highly dominant Raillietina trapezodes. Raillietina baeri was the only cestode species found in Mastomys erythroleucus, and there was no cestode in M. huberti. Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus. Local host specificity and abundance/prevalence levels suggested variations in the interaction between rodents and cestode intermediate host species among habitats and seasons. © 2010 American Society of Parasitologists.",Journal of Parasitology,96,2005,2006,cross_sectional,senegal,https://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-2437.1,

Morbidity and mortality rates are high; disease management strategies in endemic regions are ineffective and cost prohibitive. Individual variation in disease phenotype in other species suggests host factors could reveal novel treatment and control targets but has not been investigated in equids., METHODS: A prospective clinical evaluation of equines presenting for a free veterinary examination was performed in hyperendemic villages in The Gambia. Age, body condition score and body weight were estimated by validated methods, and haematocrit and total protein concentration measured. Animals fulfilling 2 out of 5 clinical inclusion criteria (anaemia, poor body condition, pyrexia, history of abortion, oedema) for a diagnosis of trypanosomiasis received trypanocidal treatment with follow-up at 1 and 2 weeks. Blood samples underwent PCR analysis with specific Trypanosoma spp. primers and results were compared to the subject's clinical and clinicopathological features. A mixed effects generalised linear model was generated to evaluate the association of infection status with degree of pyrexia and anaemia., RESULTS: Morbidity was high within examined (n = 641) and selected (n = 247) study populations. PCR status was not associated with a defined disease phenotype; there was intra- and inter-species variability. Donkeys were more frequently Trypanosoma spp.-positive (P {\textless} 0.001) and febrile (P {\textless} 0.001) than horses, but infected horses were more anaemic (P {\textless} 0.001), and in poorer body condition (P {\textless} 0.001) than donkeys. Sex was correlated to disease phenotype: males were more anaemic (P = 0.03) and febrile (P {\textless} 0.001). Haemoparasite co-infections were more common than a single infection., CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of diversity in trypanosomiasis clinical signs plus variable disease phenotypes within equid subpopulations that warrant further investigation. The complex co-infection profile of field cases requires greater consideration to optimise disease management.",Parasites \& Vectors,13,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04020-6,

Niokolo Koba National Park is considered an important biodiversity area in West Africa and has high conservation value for western chimpanzees. However, Niokolo Koba National Park has been inscribed on the World Heritage list as being in Danger since 2007 due to anthropogenic factors. Over the last 40 years, only sporadic and shortterm studies on the ecology and behavior of chimpanzees in the park have occurred. For this reason, we studied the nesting ecology of a putative chimpanzee community in the Antenna zone. We also identified sympatric medium and large mammals using a camera trap. Chimpanzees mostly used Hexalobus monopetalus for nesting, followed by Pterocarpus erinaceus. Nest heights in the Antenna zone were lower than they are in Assirik, and outside the park at Fongoli and Diaguiri sites despite the presence of potential predators in the park. Predator presence influences nesting height behavior. These data deepen our knowledge about chimpanzees in Senegal, and are useful for the management plan of the park and will contribute to an action plan for their conservation there.",Applied Ecology and Environmental Research,20,2018,2018,cross_sectional,senegal,10.15666/aeer/2003_26632681,

However, concern has been raised about this practice, since some studies have shown that the presence of cattle may instead increase malaria prevalence. This study was designed to investigate the effect of passive zooprophylaxis on malaria in an area of moderate seasonal transmission in The Gambia, West Africa. The study was based on a paired-cohort of 204 children aged {\textless} 7 years, sleeping {\textless} 20 m or {\textgreater} 50 m from cattle, and surveys were done from 14 October to 2 December 1997. Entomological investigations showed that the presence of cattle did not alter the risk of malaria transmission in nearby houses. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum between the 2 groups. Although the presence of cattle appeared to be protective against high parasitaemia, cattle were also associated with greater wealth of the children's families. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the decreased risk of high parasitaemia in the group with cattle present was an artefact associated with the higher general wealth of the cattle owners. We concluded that zooprophylaxis is not an effective intervention method against malaria in settings similar to The Gambia.",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,96,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0035-9203%2802%2990320-2,
